# Programming Fundamentals 2

This module follows on from your semester 1 module, Programming Fundamentals 1.

We will use the Java programming language throughout the module and our IDE will be IntelliJ IDEA.

In this module, we will delve deeper into the Java language and focus on topics such as menu driven systems, data structures, persistence, exceptions, inheritance, polymorphism and  abstraction.
