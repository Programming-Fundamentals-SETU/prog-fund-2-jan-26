# Tech Support App, V1 & V2 

In this section, you will:

- download the solution to Tech Support 1 that we covered in lectures. 

- familiarise yourself with the functionality and classes in the solution.

- refactor the code so that the system replies with a random response from a list of pre-defined responses (Tech Support 2).



## Tech Support 1

Download and extract the solution to [Tech Support 1](archives/tech_support_v1.zip).

Open it in IntelliJ and familiarise yourself with the code.  The app:

- is a console based system.

- is a textual dialog system i.e. you enter text on the console and the system will provide a response.
    
- responds with the same String, regardless of the content entered by the user **“That sounds interesting.  Tell me more…”**



## Tech Support 2

Create a new project in IntelliJ and call it **Tech Support V2**.

Copy the java files from **Tech Support V1** into **Tech Support V2**.

Make the necessary changes to this project so that the system provides a random response from a list of pre-defined responses e.g.:

- "That sounds interesting. Tell me more..."

- "I need a bit more information on that."

- "Have you checked that you do not have a dll conflict?"

- "That is explained in the manual. Have you read the manual?“

- " That's not a bug, it's a feature!"

- "Could you elaborate on that?“

- etc.


Use your lecture notes to support you in this task.

Test your completed app to make sure it behaves as expected.
