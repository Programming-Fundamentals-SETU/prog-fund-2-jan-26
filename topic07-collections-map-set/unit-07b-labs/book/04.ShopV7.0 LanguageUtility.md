# Challenge (ShopV7.0 - LanguageUtility)

## LanguageUtility Class

We want to use a utility to make sure we have a limited `set` of allowed languages and to have validation for those languages.  As a Set is  is a unique set of elements, and doesn't contain duplicates, this would be a perfect data structure to use.

In your `utils` package, create a new class called `LanguageUtility` and add the following code to it (again make sure you understand what is going on in it):

~~~
package utils;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class LanguageUtility {

    //Available languages in the app
    private static Set<String> languages = new HashSet<>(){{
        add("ENGLISH");
        add("GERMAN");
        add("FRENCH");
        add("SPANISH");
    }};

   
    public static Set<String> getLanguages() {
        return languages;
    }

    
    public static boolean isValidLanguage(String languageToCheck) {
        for (String language : languages) {
            if (language.equalsIgnoreCase(languageToCheck)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

}
~~~

To recap, this new utility is defining the valid languages in the Shop App, along with adding two methods, one for retrieving the set of languages and the other for checking if a specific string is a valid language.

Note: If the import error doesn't resolve itself in Product, you may need to manually import this.
