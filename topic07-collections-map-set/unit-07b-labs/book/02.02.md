# Tech Support App V3 

In this section, you will refactor the code from the previous step to have this functionality:

- Based on the user input, the system provides a context-sensitive, generated response from a list of pre-defined responses.  If the system cannot find a suitable generated response, it returns a random one.


## Tech Support 2

If you are not happy with your solution from the previous step, download and extract this version of [Tech Support V2](archives/tech_support_v2.zip).  

Open it in IntelliJ and familiarise yourself with the code.  


## Tech Support 3

Create a new project in IntelliJ and call it **Tech Support V3**.

Copy the java files from **Tech Support V2** into **Tech Support V3**.

Make the necessary changes to have this functionality:

- Based on the user input, the system provides a context-sensitive, generated response from a list of pre-defined responses.  If the system cannot find a suitable generated response, it returns a random one.
