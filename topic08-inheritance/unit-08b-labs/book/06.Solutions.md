- dessert

- baguette


The answer is:

##Exercise 2

In the Person hierarchy, Teacher and Student are both subclasses of Person. PhDStudent is a subclass of Student.

![Person Hierarchy](./img/10.png) 

~~~java
Person p1 = new Student();  // This is legal because a Student "is a" Person.  
							// We are following the direction of the arrows in the 
							// inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
Person p2 = new PhDStudent (); // This is legal because a PhDStudent "is a" Person.
  							   // We are following the direction of the arrows in the 
  							   // inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
PhDStudent phd1 = new Student(); // This is NOT legal because a Student "may not be" 
								 // a PhDStudent.  We are going against the direction  
								 // of the arrows in the inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
Teacher t1 = new Person();    // This is NOT legal because a Person "may not be" 
							  // a Teacher.  For example, the Person could be a Student.  
							  // We are going against the arrows in the 
							  // inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
Student s1 = new PhDStudent();  //This is legal because a PhDStudent "is a" Student.
							    // We are following the arrows in the inheritance diagram.
~~~


##Exercise 3

Given the Person hierarchy from Exercise 2:

![Person Hierarchy](./img/10.png) 

...suppose that we have the following legal declarations and assignments:

~~~java
Person p1 = new Person(); 
Person p2 = new Person (); 
PhDStudent phd1 = new PhDStudent(); 
Teacher t1 = new Teacher(); 
Student s1 = new Student ();
~~~

Based on these legal variable declarations, which of the following assignments are legal and why or why not?

~~~java
s1 = p1;    // This is NOT legal...a Person "may not be" a Student. 
			// We are going against the arrows in the inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
s1 = p2;    // Again, this is NOT legal...a Person "may not be" a Student. 
			// We are going against the arrows in the inheritance diagram.
~~~ 

~~~java
p1 = s1;   // This is legal...a Student "is a" Person. 
  		   // We are following the direction of the arrows in the inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
t1 = s1;   // This is NOT legal...there is no relationship between a Teacher and a 
		   // Student in our inheritance diagram. 
~~~

~~~java
s1 = phd1; // This is legal...a PhDStudent "is a" Student. 
  		   // We are following the direction of the arrows in the inheritance diagram.
~~~

~~~java
phd1 = s1;   // However, this is NOT legal...a Student "may not be" a PhDStudent. 
  		     // We are going against the direction of the arrows in the 
  		     // inheritance diagram.
~~~
