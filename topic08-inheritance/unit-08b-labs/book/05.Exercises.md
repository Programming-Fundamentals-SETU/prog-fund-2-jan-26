#Exercises

These exercises are based on the exercises in Chapter 8 of Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction Using Bluej, by David Barnes & Michael Kolling).

##Exercise 1

Order the following items into an inheritance hierarchy : 

- Apple

- IceCream

- Bread

- Fruit

- FoodItem

- Cereal

- Dessert

- ChocolateMousse

- Baguette


##Exercise 2

Assume that we have four classes : 

- Person

- Teacher

- Student

- PhDStudent


Teacher and Student are both subclasses of Person. PhDStudent is a subclass of Student.

- Which of the following assignments are legal and why or why not:

~~~
Person p1 = new Student(); 
Person p2 = new PhDStudent (); 
PhDStudent phd1 = new Student(); 
Teacher t1 = new Person(); 
Student s1 = new PhDStudent ();
~~~


##Exercise 3

Given the Person hierarchy from Exercise 2, suppose that we have the following legal declarations and assignments:

~~~java
Person p1 = new Person(); 
Person p2 = new Person (); 
PhDStudent phd1 = new PhDStudent(); 
Teacher t1 = new Teacher(); 
Student s1 = new Student ();
~~~

- Based on those just mentioned, which of the following assignments are legal and why or why not?

~~~
s1 = p1; 
s1 = p2; 
p1 = s1; 
t1 = s1; 
s1 = phd1; 
phd1 = s1;
~~~
