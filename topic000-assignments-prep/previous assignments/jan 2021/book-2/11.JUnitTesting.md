#JUnit

In the first assignment, we supplied a number of JUnit Test Classes:

- download zip file [here](archives/test.zip) 


We also provided the steps (included below) that showed you how to incorporate these test classes into your assignment.  


##JUnit Task in this Assignment

For this assignment, you are given the following Tests

- [EmployeeTest](archives/EmployeeTest.java)  This tests the methods of the (abstract) Employee class by creating a concrete subclass (AdminWorker) and then ignoring the AdminWorker-specific methods.

- [ManagerTest](archives/ManagerTest.java). This tests the methods of the Manager (concrete) class. We do not repeat the tests of the superclass method here. 

- [UtilitiesTest](archives/Utilities.java). This is partially completed. You need to complete(there are annotations in the code to indicate which new test you need. You are )


##Assignment 2 : Tests to create.
You are asked to write test classes for the following classes:

- SalesWorker

- AdminWorker

- EmployeeAPI


##Suggested approach

Once you have got the test and source files above compiling, you should write skeleton code for the following classes:

- EmployeeApi

- AdminWorker

- SalesWorker

These should just include fields and methods (start with *dummy* methods) as per the ULM diagram in the spec for each class.

IntelliJ will then help you generate Test Classes for these classes.

If you right click on the name of the class (in the Class) you get the *Context Actions* menu:

If you chose 'Create Test Class' you will get the following:

Tick all the boxes to generate a test for each of the mehods of the class (recommended). This will set up the bones of the Test Class for you. 

Then you should design the tests (perhaps start by finishing the UtilitiesTest) and write the tests. Then write the code to make these tests suceed (i.e. write the source code for the actual classes). EmployeeAPI should be the last class that you test as it depends on all the other classes being in place. 

There is no need to test the Driver.
