#The Assignment
A company maintains a database of employees working in its company. Your task is to develop a scaled-down version of their database of employees.  The menu-driven, console app will be able to handle three types of employee registration:

- AdminWorker
- SalesWorker
- Manager

You will be asked, among other things, to caclulate salary for each of the type of Employee, while using inheritance.


The information entered via the app will be persisted in an XML file.

A suggested menu is:

This system will have seven classes:

- *Employee*:  This is a superclass and has responsibility for the generic parts of all employees.

- *AdminWorker*: The responsibility for this class is to  manage a single Admin Worker and is a subclass of Employee.

- *Manager*:  The responsibility for this class is to manage a single Manager and is a subclass of Employee.

- *SalesWorker*: The responsibility for this class is to store and manage a single Sales Worker and is a subclass of Employee.

- *Driver*: The responsibility for this class is to manage the User Interface (UI) i.e. the menu and user input/ouput.

- *Utilities*: This class contains utility methods used throughout the system. All methods are static. 

- *ScannerInput* to manage input from the keyboard.


The instructions for developing the app and the above classes are on the following tabs. 


##Similar(ish) Projects

In your previous labs, you worked on a Shop project and saw an inheritance hierarchy in the Social Network project.  

Your assignment will incorporate some concepts from these projects but will require you to develop your own algorithms to solve some of the requirements given to you.

The solution to the Shop V5.0 project can be found [here](archives/ShopV5.0.zip).

The solution to the Social Network V4.0 project can be found [here](archives/network-solution-v4.zip).


##utils

We recommend using *ScannerUtility* (see the Shop project above) for all int and double input.  This will ensure a robust application for numeric data entry.  Consider also writing two additional methods in this utility class to read a line and also read a char.  That way, all of your scanner reads are in one location.

##Some key points to remember when coding your assignment

- You **must** use the names given for the Classes and Methods; failure to do so will result in reduced marks.

- For all variables, methods and classes used, please adhere to the naming standards discussed in class.

- Use internal, helper methods (i.e. private access methods) where appropriate.  The interface for your class **must** match the interface given in the assignment brief.  Deviating from the interface will result in reduced marks.  Note: the interface here refers to the fields, constructors and methods that are visible outside the class. 

- Your classes and methods should be Javadoc commented.

- Don't forget that you can get IntelliJ to generate methods such as getters, setters, constructors and toString.  It is a good idea to generate these methods and then add the additional requirements (such as validation) manually.  This will free up some time for concentrating on other areas of the assignment. 

- There should be absolutely *NO* **System.out.println** or **Scanner** reads in any class except for Driver.  If you have any such interaction with the user in any class other than Driver, you will looe marks.  Instead, you should be returning information back to Driver to print it.  Or passing information read in Driver to other classes via method parameters.
