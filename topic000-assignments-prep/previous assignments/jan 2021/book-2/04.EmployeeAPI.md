#EmployeeAPI class 

This controller class is responsible for storing and managing ALL the employees entered by the user via the console.  Note that there are no System.out.println statements in this class, nor are there any Scanner reads; all the I/O is in the other controller class, the *Driver* (and the utility classes, if you are using them).

Also note that the methods listed below are only some of the methods that you will probably require to complete the assignment.  The methods that you will add to this class will depend on the menu items that you include in the Driver class.  


##Fields

There is one private field, *employees*, which is an ArrayList of Employee. 


##Constructor

The costructor shoud instantiate the employees ArrayList.


##Methods (getters and setters)

Write getters and setters as normal.


##Methods (addEmployee)

This method will add a Employee object (passed as a parameter) to the ArrayList *employees*.  There is no validation in this method.

##Methods (addEmployeeToDepartment, two int parameters)
This method adds an employee(by index), to a manager's department(where the manager is also described by index)

##Methods (getEmployee)

This method will return an Employee object at the location *index*, which is passed as a parameter.  There is some validation in this method:

- Check that the passed index exists in the ArrayList:

    - if it does exist, retrieve the associated Employee object and return it.
	- if the passed index is not valid, return *null*. 


##Methods (removeEmployee)
You can write one of two methods:
*removeEmployee*(with index - position of employee in employees as parameter)
This method removes a Employee object at the location *index*, which is passed as a parameter.  There is some validation in this method:

- Check that the passed index exists in the ArrayList:

    - if it does exist, remove it from the ArrayList and return *the object that is just deleted*.
    - if the passed index is not valid, return *null*. 
OR

*removeEmployee*(with lastname of employee  as parameter)
There is some validation in this method:

- Check that the passed lastname exists in the ArrayList:

    - if it does exist, remove that object it from the ArrayList and return *the object that is just deleted*.
    - if the passed lastName  is not valid, return *null*. 

##Methods (numberOfEmployees)

This method returns the number of Employee objects stored in the ArrayList *employees*.


##Methods (listOfEmployees, no parameter)

This method is similar-ish to a toString.  It builds (and returns) a String of all Employee objects in the ArrayList.  Each object is on a new line.  The beginning of the line has the index number of the object in the ArrayList, as you have seen in previous toString() outputs. 


If there are no employees in the ArrayList, the following message should be returned:  **No employees stored**.


##Methods (listManagerEmployees, String parameter)

This methos builds and returns a list of employees (and their associated index number in the ArrayList) by their manager.  Each employee object should be on a new line.  

If the manager does not exist, return a message stating **this manager does not exist**.
If the manager does exist, but has no employees in his/her department, then return a message stating **This manager has no employees in his/her department**. 

##Methods (listManagerEmployees, no parameter)

This method builds and returns a list of employees who are managers.

If there are no managers in the System, **No Managers in the system** should be returned.

##Methods (searchEmployees, String parameter)

This method searches for the employee whose second name matches the String entered by the user. The position in the collection should be returned if it exists, -1 otherwise.  

Note: cater for case sensitivity in your searches i.e. *Siobhan, SIOBHAN and siobhan* should be considered the same for search purposes. 


##Methods (totalSalariesOwed)

This method adds the total salaries (including the various specific bonuses) of all the employees and returns that total value.

##Methods (averageSalaryOwed)
This method adds the total salaries (including the various specific bonuses) of all the employees and returns the average of those values.

##Methods (employeeWithHighestPay)
This method calculates the employee with the highest (total) salary and returns the Employee object of that Employee. If there are no employees, **null** should be returned. 

##Methods (sortEmployeesByFirstName)
This method sorts the employees object in ascending alphabetical order (firstname) of the employees.

##Methods (sortEmployeesBySecondName)
This method sorts the employees object in ascending alphabetical order (secondname) of the employees.

##Methods (sortEmployeesByHourlyRate)
This method sorts the employees object in ascending numerical order of the employees' hourly-rate.



##Methods (save)

This method saves all Employee objects from the ArrayList employees to an XML file *employees.xml*.  You can use the *xstream* component for this (like we did in class) or any approach you wish.


##Methods (load)

This method loads all saved Employee objects back into the program (i.e into the ArrayList employee) from the XML file *employees.xml*.  You can use the *xstream* component for this (like we did in class) or any approach you wish.
