#Submitting your assignment

When you are ready to submit your assignment:

- Rename your project name using the naming convention **firstname_surname** e.g. maireaed_meagher. (inside IntelliJ)

- Zip this folder ensuring that it is called  **firstname_surname.zip**.  No WINRARs please!

- The deadline for this assignment is **10 pm Sunday, 8th December 2019**.


##Interviews

As you know, it is **compulsory** that you are interviewed on your submission in order to demonstrate both *Understanding* and *Authorship*.  

These interviews will typically take place in labs the week after submission.  

The grade for the interview is a multiplier for your assigment grade.  Should you fail to show for your interview, you will receive zero, resulting in an overall grade of zero for your submission.
