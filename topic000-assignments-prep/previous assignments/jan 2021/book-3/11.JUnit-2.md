#JUnit

In the first assignment, we supplied a number of JUnit Test Classes:

- download zip file [here](archives/test.zip) 

We also provided the steps (included below) that showed you how to incorporate these test classes into your assignment.  


##JUnit Task in this Assignment

For this assignment, you are given the following partial test classes:

- [EmployeeTest](archives/EmployeeTest.java)  This tests the methods of the (abstract) Employee class by creating a concrete subclass (AdminWorker) and then ignoring the AdminWorker-specific methods.

- [ManagerTest](archives/ManagerTest.java). This tests the methods of the Manager (concrete) class. We do not repeat the tests of the superclass method here. 

Note that there are several 'todo' comments in the above classes; completing these would be sufficient for full marks in both these classes.  


##Assignment 2 : Tests to create.
You are asked to write test classes for the following java classes:

- Qualification

- SalesWorker

- AdminWorker

- EmployeeAPI


##Suggested approach

Once you have got the test and source files above compiling, you should write skeleton code for the following java classes:

- Qualification

- EmployeeApi

- AdminWorker

- SalesWorker

These should just include the fields and methods that we detailed in the previous tabs.  It's a good idea to start with near-empty *dummy* methods.

IntelliJ will then help you generate Test Classes for these classes.  If you right click on the name of the class (in the code) you get this context sensitive menu:

Select *Show Context Actions*, then choose 'Create Test Class'.  You will get the following:

Select 'Create Test' and when prompted, tick all the boxes to generate a test for each of the mehods of the class (recommended). This will set up the bones of the Test Class for you. 


##Test Driven Development Approach

Adopting a Test Driven Development approach:

- You should design the tests for each class (perhaps start by finishing the EmployeeTest and ManagerTest first) and then write the code for the tests. 

- Write the code to make these tests succeed (i.e. write the source code for the actual classes). EmployeeAPI should be the last class that you test as it depends on all the other classes being in place. 

- Run the tests to see them pass.


Note: There is no need to test the Driver or our Utility class code.  However, if you do add new methods to the Utility class, you would need to provide test methods for them (in a new class called UtilityTest.java).
