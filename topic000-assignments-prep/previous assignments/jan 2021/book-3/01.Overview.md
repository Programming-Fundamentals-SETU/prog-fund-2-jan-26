#Overview

In this tab, we will give a brief overview of the assignment, the submission details (and date) and the marking scheme.

#What is different to Assignment 2

The following has been added in this assignment:

1. A new class: Qualification. 
2. More fields in Employee:
    - private String name;  //max 50 chars
    - private String phoneNumber; //must contain numbers only
    - private String email; //must contain @ and .
    - private String ppsNo; //must contain 8 characters only (first 7 chars are numbers, last char must be a letter).
    - private ArrayList<Qualification> qualifications = new ArrayList<>();
3. More methods in Employee class:
    - accessor and mutators for each field listed above.
    - an addQualification and a removeQualification method.
    - a method, getSummaryDetails(), that will return a String in the following format: **Mairead Meagher (mmeagher)@wit.ie, 08435233).  PPS: 1234567T.**
4. The sub classes of Employee will override the getSummaryDetails() so that they will each return the details with the associated salary e.g. *Mairead Meagher (mmeagher@wit.ie, 08435233).  PPS: 1234567T.  Salary: €1,234,567.* 
5. Finally, make whatever changes you like to Driver and EmpAPI to utilise this new functionality e.g. make sure you are reading in qualifications when adding an Employee, maybe have a search option for viewing all BSc qualifications, have a option that will display the summary details of all employees in a department etc.


#The Assignment Overview

A company maintains a database of employees working in its company. Your task is to develop a scaled-down version of their database of employees.  The menu-driven, console app will be able to handle three types of employee registration:

- AdminWorker
- SalesWorker
- Manager

You will be asked, among other things, to caclulate salary for each of the type of Employee, while using inheritance.

The information entered via the app will be persisted in an XML file.

A suggested menu is:

![](img/menu.png)

This system will have eight classes:

- *Employee*:  This is a superclass and has responsibility for the generic information relating to all employees.

- *AdminWorker*: The responsibility for this class is to  manage a single Admin Worker and is a subclass of Employee.

- *Manager*:  The responsibility for this class is to manage a single Manager and is a subclass of Employee.

- *SalesWorker*: The responsibility for this class is to store and manage a single Sales Worker and is a subclass of Employee.

- *Qualification*: The responsibliity for this class is to store and manage a single Qualification.  The Employee class will manage a collection of these Qualifications for each employee.

- *Driver*: The responsibility for this class is to manage the User Interface (UI) i.e. the menu and user input/ouput.

- *Utilities*: This class contains utility methods used throughout the system. All methods are static. 

- *ScannerInput* to manage input from the keyboard.

The instructions for developing the app and the above classes are on the following tabs. 


#Submitting your assignment

When you are ready to submit your assignment:

- Rename your project name using the naming convention **firstname_surname** e.g. maireaed_meagher. (inside IntelliJ)

- Zip this folder ensuring that it is called  **firstname_surname.zip**.  No WINRARs please!

- The deadline for this assignment is **5pm Sunday, 30th August 2020**.


##Interviews

As you know, it is **compulsory** that you are interviewed on your submission in order to demonstrate both *Understanding* and *Authorship*.  

These interviews will typically take place the first week of September.  Under the Covid-19 circumstances, we will more than likely be interviewing you over Zoom.

The grade for the interview is a multiplier for your assigment grade.  Should you fail to show for your interview, you will receive zero, resulting in an overall grade of zero for your submission.  


##Early Interviews

You can avail of an early interview in June.  If you would like to do this, please contact  Mairead by 12th June (mmeagher@wit.ie).  We can then arrange a time that suits both for an interview for you.  Please note that we are on academic holidays after 20th June, so any early interviews must be done prior to that date. 


#Indicative Marking Scheme

The marking scheme for the assignment is as follows:
							
 - 10%: Employee Class (8%) and finishing EmployeeTest (2%) 

 - 8%: Qualification Class (4%) and writing QualificationTest (4%)
            
 - 8%: Manager Class (6%) and finishing ManagerTest (2%)

 - 8%: SalesWorker Class (4%) and writing SalesWorkerTest (4%)
 
 - 8%: AdminWorker Class (4%) and writing AdminWorker Test (4%)

 - 29%: EmployeeAPI Class

 - 10%: EmployeeAPITest

 - 8%: Driver
							
 - 3%: Writing additional Utilities methods and associated test methods	- 3%
							
 - 4%: Javadoc on either EmpAPI or the four classes in the Employee Hierarchy.
 
 - 4% - Coding standards, naming, style, etc


The above totals to 100%. This is subject to slight change.


#Other info


##Similar(ish) Projects

In your previous labs, you worked on a Shop project and saw an inheritance hierarchy in the Social Network project.  

Your assignment will incorporate some concepts from these projects but will require you to develop your own algorithms to solve some of the requirements given to you.

The solution to the Shop V5.0 project can be found [here](archives/ShopV5.0.zip).

The solution to the Social Network V4.0 project can be found [here](archives/network-solution-v4.zip).


##utils

We recommend using *ScannerUtility* (see the Shop project above) for all int and double input.  This will ensure a robust application for numeric data entry.  
Consider also writing two additional methods in this utility class to read a line and also read a char.  That way, all of your Scanner reads are in one location.


##Some key points to remember when coding your assignment

- For all classes, methods and  variables, please adhere to the naming standards discussed in class.

- Use internal, helper methods (i.e. private access methods) where appropriate.  
- Javadoc - to get the full Javadoc marks, you will need to correctly Javadoc the EmployeeAPI class.  However, it is a good exercise to Javadoc your entire project so that you can easily review the project prior to interview.   

- Don't forget that you can get IntelliJ to generate methods such as getters, setters, constructors and toString.  It is a good idea to generate these methods and then add the additional requirements (such as validation) manually.  This will free up some time for concentrating on other areas of the assignment. 

- There should be absolutely *NO* **System.out.println** or **Scanner** reads in any class except for Driver and ScannerInput.  If you have any such interaction with the user in any other class, you will loose marks.  Note: you should be returning information back to Driver to print it.  Or passing information read in Driver to other classes via method parameters.

- You are permitted to use the solutions for any lab work while developing this assignment.  However, please do not take work from another source without clear referencing; to do so is plagiarism and will result in a reduced grade/zero depending on the severity of the plagiarism.
