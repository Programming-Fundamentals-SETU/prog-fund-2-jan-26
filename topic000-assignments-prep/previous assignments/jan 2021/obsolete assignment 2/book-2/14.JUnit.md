#JUnit


You are given this folder of tests [here](archives/test.zip)

##Starter Code that we give out:

- EducationAppTest - 100% code coverage with 100% coverage for App model too.
- DeveloperTest - 100% code coverage (this is to come)
- UtilitiesTest - 100% code coverage.
- AppStoreAPI - partially done - you need to complete this


##What you need to develop:

- A test class for App and all the concrete subclasses (other than the given EducationAppTest), i.e GameAppTest, ProductivityGameApp. (Note: to test the abstract App, your test data should use concrete objects, e.g. GameApp - you need only test the App non-abstract methods in this test class)
- AppStoreAPI - achieve a code coverage of at least  90% (starter test code provided).  Note: code coverage percentage is based on all the functionality completed.
- RatingTest
- DeveloperAPITest
