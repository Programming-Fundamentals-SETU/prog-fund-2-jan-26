#ProductivityApp class

The responsibility for this *concrete* class is to extend App and implement the class for an ProductivityApp.  The UML is here:

NOTES: 

- You may add additional instance fields of your choice.  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow.  
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

#Fields

There is one private field in this class:

- *productivityCategory* : this field should use  the CategoryUtility for validation. (You need to add this detail) If a valid productivity category is not supplied, the default productivity category should be used.   
  The valid categories are
   -  Mail
   - ToDoList
   - Notes
   - Messages
   - Calendar
   - Productivity

#Constructor

There is one constructor for this class. 

The parameter list for this constructor should be the same as the parameter list for the App class but with one additional field (productivityCategory).  

The constructor should call the superclass constructor and also instantiate the other field (with validation).


#Abstract methods

- getCategory - this is simply a getter for the productivityCategory field
- setCategory - this is a setter for the productivityCategory field with the validation above included.
- isRecommendedApp - this is a more involved method and returns a boolean indicating if the app is recommended or not.  The algorithm for recommending a ProductivityApp is:

~~~
        // Algorithm - app is recommended if the following applies:
        //      inAppPurchase is false;
        //      appCost is >= 1.99
        //      rating of > 3.0
        //      category is not the default of Utility
~~~

#JUnit Test Class

You are asked to write the Test Class for ProductivityApp. You should use the test class for EducationApp as inspiration.
