#Utils Package
The utils package contains collections of utilities, grouped by function. You can choose to validate without the use of these packages but it will be more time consuming and you will lose marks. 

## Utilities
We are giving  you  code for [Utilities.java](archives/Utilities.java).  The responsibility for the class is to store the reusable Utility (general) methods in one area.
