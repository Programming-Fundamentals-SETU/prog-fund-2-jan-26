#GameApp class

The responsibility for this *concrete* class is to extend App and implement the class for an GameApp.  The UML is here:

NOTES: 

- You may add additional instance fields of your choice.  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow.  
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

---


#Fields

There are two private fields in this class:

- *isMultiplayer* : This is either true or false, with a default value of false. 
- *gameGenre* : this field should use  the CategoryUtility for validation.  If a valid game genre is not supplied, the default game genre should be used.  
  The valid game categories are:
  - Action 
  - Puzzle
  - Card
  - Strategy
  - Trivia
  - General

#Constructor

There is one constructor for this class. 

The parameter list for this constructor should be the same as the parameter list for the App class but with two additional fields (gameGenre, level).  

The constructor should call the superclass constructor and also instantiate the other two fields (with validation, where appropriate).


#Abstract methods

- getCategory - this is simply a getter for the gameGenre field
- setCategory - this is a setter for the gameGenre field with the validation above included.
- isRecommendedApp - this is a more involved method and returns a boolean indicating if the app is recommended or not.  The algorithm for recommending a GameApp is:

~~~
        // Algorithm - app is recommended if the following applies:
        //      inAppPurchase is true;
        //      numberofDownloads >= 100
        //      rating of >= 4.0
~~~

#JUnit Test Class

You are asked to write the Test Class for GameApp. You should use the test class for EducationApp as imspiration.
