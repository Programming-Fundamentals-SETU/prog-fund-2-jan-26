#AppStoreAPI class 



This API class is responsible for storing and managing ALL the Apps in the system.  The **starter** UML is here:

![](img/AppStoreAPI.png)



NOTES: 

- There are no System.out.println statements in this class, nor are there any Scanner reads; all the I/O is in the other controller class, the *Driver* (and the utility classes, if you are using them).

- The methods listed above are only some of the methods that you will probably require to complete the assignment.  The methods that you will add to this class will depend on the menu items that you include in the Driver class.  

---

#Fields

There is one private field, *apps*, which is an ArrayList of App. 



#Constructor

The constructor should instantiate the apps ArrayList.



#getter and setter methods

Write getters and setters as normal for all instance fields, with validation where appropriate. 



---

#Basic CRUD on apps ArrayList



##addApp

This method will add an App object (passed as a parameter) to the ArrayList *Apps*.  There is no validation in this method.



##deleteAppByIndex ( with index - position of app in apps as parameter)
  This method removes a App object at the location *index*, which is passed as a parameter.  There is some validation in this method.  
  - Check that the passed index exists in the ArrayList:
      - if it does exist, remove it from the ArrayList and return *the object that was just deleted*.
      - if the passed index is not valid, return *null*. 
        
##deleteAppByName (with name of App  as parameter)
  This method removes a App object at the location *index*, which is passed as a parameter.  
  There is some validation in this method:
  - Check that the passed name(of App) exists in the ArrayList:
      - if it does exist, remove that object it from the ArrayList and return *the object that is just deleted*.  You can assume here that you can delete the first object you have found matching the last name.
      - if the passed name (of App) is not valid, return *null*. 


##getAppByIndex( with index - position of app in apps as parameter)
 This method returns a App object at the location *index*, which is passed as a parameter.  There is some validation in this method.  
  - Check that the passed index exists in the ArrayList:
      - if it does exist, return *the object at that position*.
      - if the passed index is not valid, return *null*. 

##getAppByName( with name - name of app  as parameter)
 This method returns a App object with that *name*, which is passed as a parameter.  There is some validation in this method.  
  - Check that the passed *name* exists in the ArrayList:
      - if it does exist, remove it from the ArrayList and return *the object with that name*.
      - if the passed index is not valid, return *null*.

#Reporting Methods


##listAllApps()
This method should return a String containing the details of all the apps in **apps**
If no such apps exist, **"No apps"** should be returned.

##listSummaryOfAllApps()
This method should return a String containing the summary of all the apps in **apps** (use the **appSummary()** method as defined in App)
If no such apps exist, **"No apps"** should be returned.


##listAllGameApps()
This method should return a String containing the details of all the Game apps in **apps** 
If no such apps exist, **"No Game apps"** should be returned.


##listAllEducationApps()
This method should return a String containing the details of all the Education apps in **apps** 
If no such apps exist, **"No Education apps"** should be returned.


##listAllProductivityApps()
This method should return a String containing the details of all the Productivity apps in **apps** 
If no such apps exist, **"No Productivity apps"** should be returned.

##listAllAppsByLicenseType(licenceType (String) as a parameter)
If the given licenceType as given is valid, this should return a String containing details of all the Apps with this licence type. 
If the licence type is invalid, or there are no Apps with this licence type, **"No apps for licence: `licenceType`** should be returned.

##listAllAppsByName(with name(String) as a parameter)
This method should return the list of Apps whose name contains this name.
If no such app exists, **No apps for name `appName`** exists.

##listAllAppsAboveGivenStarRating( with int rating as a parameter)
This method should return a String containing the details of all the apps in **apps** which have a rating equal to or above the given rating.
If no such app exists, **"No apps have a rating of " + rating + " or above" ** should be returned. 




##listAllAppsBelowAgeRating(int rating as a parameter)
This method should return a String containing the details of all the apps in **apps** which have a age rating  less than the given rating.
If no such app exists, **"No apps have an age rating of " + rating + " or lower"** should be returned.


##listAllAppsByCategory(with  categoryType(String) as a parameter)
This method should return a String with all the apps with the given category type. 
If no such app exists, **"No apps for category: " + categoryType ** should be returned.



##listAllRecommendedApps(with no parameter)
This should return a String containing all the apps that are **recommended** (according to the specific sub-class algorithms).
If no such apps exist, **"No recommended apps" ** should be returned.


##listAllAppsByChosenDeveloper(with a developer object given as parameter) 

This method searches through the apps collection for the apps whose developer field matches the given developer object (given as parameter). 
If no such apps exist, **"No apps for developer: " + developer ** should be returned.




##numberOfAppsByChosenDeveloper(with a developer object given as parameter)
This methid returns the number of Apps writtedn by a given developer. 


##randomApp(with no parameter)
This method should return a random App from the collection. If no app exists, **null** should be returned. 

##simulateAppDownloads(with no parameter)
This method should randomly allocate a number of downloads to each app in the collection (max num of downloads = 1000)

##simulateRatings(with no parameter)
This method should randomly allocate a ratings  to each app in the collection 

---


#Validation Methods

##isValidIndex(  with index - position of app in apps as parameter)
This method will return 
  - **true** if that index exists in the **apps** collection
  - **false** if that index does not exist in the **apps** collection
(This method can be used to implement *getAppByIndex(..)* below)

##isValidAppName( with name - name of app  as parameter)
This method will return 
  - **true** if an App with that name exists
  - **false** if no App with that name exists

(This method can be used to implement *getAppByName(..)* below)



##getAppByName(with appName (String) as parameter)
This method should return an app object that matches this name, if it exists in the apps collection, otherwise, **null** should be returned. 

##getAppByIndex(with (integer) index as parameter)
This method should return an app object at that given position, if that positin exists in the apps collection, otherwise, **null** should be returned.

#Sorting Methods

##sortAppsByNameAscending()
This method should change the apps object so that it is sorted by name in ascending order. 

##sortAppsByAgeRatingAscending()
This method should change the apps object so that it is sorted by ageRating in ascending order. 

##sortAppsByNumberOfDownloadsDescending()
This method should change the apps object so that it is sorted by number of downloads  in descending order. 


##swapApps (List<App> apps, int i, int j)
This should be a private method that swaps the objects at positions i and j in the collection **apps**. This method should be used in your sorting methods. 



---

#Persistence

##save

This method saves all App objects from the ArrayList Apps to an XML file *apps.xml*.  You can use the *xstream* component for this (like we did in class) or any approach you wish.



##load

This method loads all saved App objects back into the program (i.e into the ArrayList apps) from the XML file *apps.xml*.  You can use the *xstream* component for this (like we did in class) or any approach you wish.


##fileName()
This method should return the file that the apps collection is saved to/load from.

#JUnit Test Class



A partial test class for AppStoreAPI given [here.](archives/AppStoreTest.java). You are asked to complete the given test class.  You can check how complete your updated test class is by using the **Coverage** Tool in **Intellij**.
