#Hierarchy Overview

The following UML diagram shows the Inheritance structure, with fields and methods.

##While developing this hierarchy, remember the following:

The UML above is a **starting point** for the classes and, you are free to add any additional instance fields you choose.  If you do add more fields, your method list and parameters for existing methods, will change/grow.

As soon as you have entered the fields for a class in IntelliJ, generate boilerplate methods i.e. 
- *constructor*
  Constructors should adhere to the validation rules outlined for the instance fields.  They should provide a default value if the value passed as a parameter was invalid.
- *getters*
  Each instance field should have a getter method.  
- *setters* 
  Each instance field should have a setter method.  Setters should adhere to the validation rules outlined for the instance fields.  However, a setter should not apply a default value; it should only update the field if the value passed as a parameter was valid. 
- *equals* 
- *toString*
  The *toString* methods in the subclasses (*AdminWorker, Manager, Lecturer*) should return a String version of the current object state as well as the object state of the super class, Employee.  

When coding the validation rules in the constructor and setters, you can use methods from the *utils* classes to perform the validation (see **utils** tab for more information).  

Pay attention to the format and the icons in the UML code above...they will tell you a huge amount about writing the code.  We have included some helpful graphics below to illustrate this for you.
