#Assignment Overview

You are tasked with developing a *Note Keeper* Menu Driven, CRUD-compliant system.

A sample meun is here:

You will see there are two main entities on the menu...Notes and Items.  

Here are a few rules associated with them:

- The app can have zero-many notes.  

- Notes can be Active or Archived.

- Notes have a priority, 1-5, with 1 being low.  

- Notes have a category.  Pre-defined categories are lised later in the spec.

- A note can have zero-many items on it, so a note doesn't have to have items. 

- Each item on a note is either in Completed or TODO state. 

- Items can only be added to Active notes.

- A note can be archived (through a menu option) when all the items are completed on it.  You can also archive a note that has NO items on it.  Any note that has TODO items on it cannot be archived until the item is complete.


#Classes in the System

The *Note Keeper* app will have four main classes (the blue ones):

- *Note*:  The responsibility for this class is to manage a single Note in the System.  A note has multiple items in it.  

- *Item*: The responsibility for this class is to manage a single Item in the system.  An item belongs to a specific Note. 

- *NoteAPI*: The responsibility for this class is to store and manage all the notes in the system.

- *Driver*: The responsibility for this class is to manage the User Interface (UI) i.e. the menu and user input/output.


#Other Classes in the System

There are three other classes in the System (the orange ones):

- *ScannerInput*: The methods of this class are used in the Driver class.  These methods provide robust Scanner reads of any user input.  The [*ScannerInput.java code is here*](archives/ScannerInput.java); just include it as a class in your project.

- *Utilities*:  This class is used throughout the system and has a series of helper methods (for validation) in it.  The [*Utilities.java code from ShopV5.0 is here*](archives/Utilities.java); just include it as a class in your project.

- *CategoryUtility*: This is a second Utility class that you must write yourself.  It is used to validate the categories of notes.  


#Classes and ArrayLists 

Within the system, there are two ArrayLists::

We will discuss each ArrayList in turn, in the following tabs.


#Instructions for Developing System

The instructions for developing the system and the above classes are on the following tabs. 

We recommend, that you read the ENTIRE specification BEFORE starting to code.
