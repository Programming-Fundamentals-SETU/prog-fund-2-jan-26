##Some key points to remember when coding your assignment

- You **must** use the names given for the Classes and Methods; failure to do so will result in reduced marks.

- For all variables, methods and classes used, please adhere to the naming standards discussed in class.

- Use internal, helper methods (i.e. private access methods) where appropriate.  The interface for your class **must** match the interface given in the assignment brief.  Deviating from the interface will result in reduced marks.  Note: the interface here refers to the fields, constructors and methods that are visible outside the class. 

- Your classes and methods should be Javadoc commented.

- Don't forget that you can get IntelliJ to generate methods such as getters, setters, constructors and toString.  It is a good idea to generate these methods and then add the additional requirements (such as validation) manually.  This will free up some time for concentrating on other areas of the assignment. 

- There should be absolutely *NO* **System.out.println** or **Scanner** reads in any class except for SixNationsDriver.  If you have any such interaction with the user in any class other than SixNationsDriver, you will lose marks.  Instead, you should be returning information back to SixNationsDriver to print it.  Or passing information read in SixNationsDriver to other classes via method parameters.


#Plan of Attack

The following is a suggest plan of attack to start and complete the assignment 

#Step 1
Create a new Project in the usual way. Mine is called *DemoSixNations*.

#Step 2
Write a minimal Utilities class containing code for these three methods: 

~~~


public class Utilities {

    public static boolean onlyContainsNumbers(String text) {
          return (text.matches("[0-9]+"));
    }

    public static boolean max30Chars(String string){
        return (string.length()<=30) ? true : false;
    }

    public static boolean validEmail(String email){
        return (email.contains("@") && email.contains("."));
    }
}

~~~

This starting Utilities file is available for download [*here*](archives/Utilities.java)
#Step 3
Download the following (partial) test file for Utilities [*here*](archives/StartUtilitiesTest.java)

To test your code  you need to run this test code by using JUnit for the first time. 

#Step 3
Create a new Directory called test from here: 


![](img/demo_1.png)


#Step 4 
This should look like 

![](img/demo_2.png)

#Step 5
Now drag your downloaded *StartUtilitiesTest.java* file into this directory. It should now look like this: 

![](img/demo_3.png)


#Step 6 
Next, we need to mark the test folder as the source for all the test files in the project, by right-clicking on the test folder -> choosing 'Mark Directory As' and then 'Test Resources Root'. 

![](img/demo_4.png)

(This tells Intellij that this folder  contains all the test files.)

#Step 7
 Now, you will see 


![](img/demo_5.png)

Note 
 - The test folder is now coloured green
 - If you open the StartUtilitiesTest code, you will see there are errors. These errors occur as we don't have the Junit libraries properly installed in this project. 

#Step 8
The easiest way to fix this is to use Intellij to help us fix this problem. Position your cursor over one of the offending 'junit' errors (they show up in red). Right click to get the following menu : 

![](img/demo_6.png)

Click on the 'Show Context Actions' and you will see 

![](img/demo_7.png)

Click on 'Add 'JUnit4' to classpath. 

This should remove all the errors in the *StartUtilitiesTest.java* file. 

You are now ready to run the tests. 

#Step 9
Right-click on the *StartUtilitiesTest.java* file.   You will see the following menu: 

![](img/demo_8.png)

Click on 'Run StartUtilitiesTest'

You should see that all the tests have passed by seeing this at the bottom of the Intellij window: 

![](img/demo_9.png)

This means that the Utilities code that we have written works as planned. 


We now repeat this process for the rest of the project. i.e. 


#Step 10
Now, write the Player class in the *src* folder according to the spec in this document. (Use the Utilities that you are give to you earlier). Then add the given PlayerTest class (to the *test* folder). You can run this test immediately as th JUnit environment is set up from the last step.
Then 'Run All Tests', it will look this : 

![](img/demo_10.png)

If there are errors, fix these errors, and re-run. Continue doing this until you get the green lines. 

#Step 11 
Next, create and write the code for *Club* (according to spec), then add the *ClubTest* test class to the test folder, run that test, keep improving code until the tests succeed. 

#Step 12 
Next Next, create and write the code for *Country* (according to spec), then add the *CountryTest* test class to the test folder, run that test, keep improving code until the tests succeed. 

#Step 13
Next, create and write the code for *SixNationsDriver* (according to spec), then add the *SixNationsDriverTest* test class to the test folder, run that test, keep improving code until the tests succeed. 

When you have all the tests running you are done.
