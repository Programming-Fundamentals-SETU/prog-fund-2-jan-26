#NOTE MENU Options

##Option 1 - Add a note

Create an *addNote()* method in Driver.  This method asks the user to enter the following:

- note title, 
- note priority
- note category

The note is added to the ArrayList of notes (i.e. in *noteAPI*). If the add was successful, output a message to the console alerting the user of this.  Likewise, if the add was not successful, alert the user to this via a message printed to the console. 


##Option 2 - List all notes

Create a *viewNotes()* method in Driver.  This method asks the user if they would like to see:

- All notes (call the Driver method **printAllNotes()** that prints the number of notes along with all notes and their associated items)

- Active notes (call the Driver method **printActiveNotes()** that prints the number of active notes along with all active notes and their associated items)

- Archived notes (call the Driver method **printArchivedNotes()** that prints the number of archived notes along with all archived notes and their associated items)


Sample output for all notes could be:
