#Note Class

The responsibility for this class is to manage a single Note in the System.  A note has multiple items in it.

**Remember, as soon as you enter the fields in a class in IntelliJ, you can GENERATE getters, setters, constructors and toString methods.  They are only basic methods and may need to be modified e.g. to add validation, change the format of the generated toString, etc.**

#Fields

There are five private fields in the Note class:

- *notetitle*: is maximum 20 characters.  When creating a new note, if no title is supplied, you should default the text "No Title".  When updating noteTitle, you should only update if the value is less than or equal to 20.  

- *notePriority*: should only contain a value from 1 to 5 inclusive.  When creating a new note, if no priority is supplied, you should default the Priority to 1.

- *noteCategory*: should contain only one of the following categories: "Home", "Work", "Hobby", "Holiday", "College".  When creating a new note, if no category is supplied, you should default the empty String, "".

- *isNoteArchived*: should be either true or false.  When creating a new note, it should be defaulted to false.  

- *items*: is an ArrayList of `Item`.  This should be initialised at variable declaration time. There are several methods listed below for handling this list. 
 
**Hint: you can use Utilities validation methods to perform the above validation (see Utilities tab for more information).  We have provided some methods, but you would need to write more.**

#Constructor

There is one constructor that should have the same method signature as the diagram above e.g.:

~~~
public Note(String noteTitle, int notePriority, String noteCategory)
~~~  

The constructor should enforce the validation rules outlined for each field above. 

---

#Methods (getters and setters)

Each of the above fields will have a getter and a setter.  The setters should adhere to the validation rules outlined above.  

Remember that a setter should not apply a default value i.e. if an invalid noteTitle is entered, do not overwrite the existing stored value with "No Title"; just ignore the update.

#Methods for ArrayList Handling

There are several methods for handling the ArrayList, items:

- addItem(Item item)
- listItems()
- updateItem(int index, String itemDescription, boolean itemCompleted)
- deleteItem(int index)
- numberOfItems()
- isValidIndex(int index)
- checkNoteCompletionStatus()

Each of these will be discussed in turn.

## addItem(Item item)

This method adds an item object to the ArrayList *items* and returns the boolean result of the add.  

Hint: go to the Java API documentation for the ArrayList add method; you will notice that it returns a boolean indicating success / failure of the add. 


## listItems()

This method should return a String, which should be either:

 - the list of items (including index number) if there are items in the note.
 - the string "No items added" if there are no items added yet. 


## updateItem(int index, String itemDescription, boolean itemCompleted)

This method should attempt to retrieve the item stored at the index number passed as a parameter.  If the item:

- doesn't exist, return false, indicating the update was not successful.
- exists, use the Item mutators to update both the description and the completion status with the details passed in the parameter list.  Finally, return true to indicate a successful update.


## deleteItem(int index)

This method deletes an item at the index parameter (if that index exists) and returns the deleted item object. If the index does not exist in the items list, then null should be returned. 


## numberOfItems()

This method simply returns the number of items stored in the items ArrayList. 


## isValidIndex(int index)

This method checks that the index, passed as a parameter is a valid index in the items ArrayList.  If it is a valid index, return true.  If invalid, return false.


## checkNoteCompletionStatus()

This method looks at the completion status for each item on a note.  If:

- ALL items are completed, return true. 
- one or more item is TODO, return false.
- the note has no items, return true.

#equals(Object)

This method checks equality between notes. The code for the Note version of equals is:

~~~
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Note note = (Note) o;
        return notePriority == note.notePriority 
                            && isNoteArchived 
                            == note.isNoteArchived 
                            && Objects.equals(noteTitle, note.noteTitle) 
                            && Objects.equals(noteCategory, note.noteCategory) 
                            && Objects.equals(items, note.items);
    }
~~~

#toString()

This method builds a user friendly string representation of the object and returns it e.g.
