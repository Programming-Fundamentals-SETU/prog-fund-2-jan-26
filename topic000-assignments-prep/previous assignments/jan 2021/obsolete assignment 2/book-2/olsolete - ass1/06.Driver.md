#Driver Class

The responsibility of the Driver class is to run the app and perform I/O with the user.  It is the only class that should have:

- System.out.print statements
- ScannerInput method calls.

#Fields

There is one private field in the *Driver* class:

- **noteAPI**: this holds and manages the collection (ArrayList) of *notes* and is instantiated at variable declaration time. 


#main method

The main method has one line of code:

~~~
new Driver();
~~~


##Constructor

We will write a default constructor for this class.  There is one line of code in this method:

~~~
public Driver() {
        runMenu();
    }
~~~


#Menu Displayed

Using the same approach adopted when deveoping the Shop projets, the following menu is *continually* displayed to the user:

Note that the *mainMenu()* method displays the above menu and returns the user choice.  The *runMenu* method is the one that contains the switch statement that processes the user choice.  

A desciption of each menu option is on the next tab.
