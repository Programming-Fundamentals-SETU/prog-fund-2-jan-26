## JUnit


## Starter JUnit Code that we give out:

- [EducationAppTest](archives/EducationAppTest.java) - 100% code coverage with 100% coverage for App model too.
- [AppStoreAPITest](archives/AppStoreAPITest.java) - partially done - you need to complete this.


## What you need to develop:

- **GameAppTest** - model this on the EducationAppTest code above.  Aim for 100% coverage.
- **ProductivityAppTest** - model this on the EducationAppTest code above.  Aim for 100% coverage.
- **AppStoreAPITest** - achieve a code coverage of at least 90% (starter test code provided above).  Note: code coverage percentage is based on all the functionality completed.
