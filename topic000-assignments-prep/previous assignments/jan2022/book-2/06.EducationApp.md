# EducationApp class

The responsibility for this *concrete* class is to extend App and implement the class for an EducationApp.  The UML is here:

NOTES: 

- You may add additional instance fields of your choice (for extra credit!).  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow.  
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

## Fields

There is one private field in this class:

- *level* : This is the education level the app is aimed at.  It should be between 1 and 10 (both inclusive). Default value is 0.


## Constructor

There is one constructor for this class.  The parameter list for this constructor should be the same as the parameter list for the App class but with the additional field (level).  The constructor should call the superclass constructor and also instantiate the other field (with validation).


## Abstract method

`isRecommendedApp` - this method returns a boolean indicating if the app is recommended or not.  The algorithm for recommending an EducationApp is:

~~~
        // Algorithm - app is recommended if the following applies:
        //      appCost is greater than 0.99
        //      calculated rating is greater than or equal to 3.5
        //      level is 3 or more.
~~~
