NOTES: 

- You may add additional instance fields of your choice (for extra credit!).  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow.  
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

## Fields

There are no specific fields relating to this class.


## Constructor

There is one constructor for this class.  The parameter list for this constructor should be the same as the parameter list for the App class.  The constructor should call the superclass constructor.


## Abstract method

isRecommendedApp - this method returns a boolean indicating if the app is recommended or not.  The algorithm for recommending a ProductivityApp is:

~~~
        // Algorithm - app is recommended if the following applies:
        //      appCost is greater tahn or equal to 1.99
        //      calculated rating of more than 3.0 
~~~


## JUnit Test Class

You are asked to write the Test Class for ProductivityApp. You should use the test class for EducationApp as inspiration.
