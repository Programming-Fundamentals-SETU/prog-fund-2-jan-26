# Submitting your assignment

When you are ready to submit your assignment:

- Rename (inside IntelliJ, using **Refactoring**) your project name using the naming convention *firstnamesurname* e.g. *maireadmeagher* 

- Zip the folder containing all the project files, and name the folder *firstname_surname.zip*.  Please use the .zip extension (7Zip allows you to do this too).

- The deadline for this assignment is  **6pm, Sunday, 8th May**.

- It is compulsory that you are interviewed on your submission in order to demonstrate both Understanding and Authorship.

  - These interviews will take place on **Tues/Wed 10th/11th May**.  A schedule will be published nearer the time. 
  
- The grade for the interview is a multiplier for your assignment grade. Should you fail to show for your interview, you will receive zero, resulting in an overall grade of zero for your submission.

## Checklist before submitting your assignment

- You are permitted to use the solutions for any lab work while developing this assignment.  You do not need to reference these in your work.

- Check your work for potential plagiarism issues.  These are excerpts from WIT's anti-plagiarism policy:

~~~
"To plagiarise is when you use the ideas or words of another person without giving them explicit credit.
Plagiarism therefore is passing off the work of others as one’s own. It is defined by the act not the 
intention, so even careless accidental copying is still classed as plagiarism, for it gives the false
impression that the student is the author and denies the genuine author their due acknowledgement."


Indicators and/or proof of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

	- First-hand observation of the student engaging in plagiarism;
	- Identification of the source of the materials used by the student without proper attribution, or represented as the student’s own work;
	- A demonstrably marked difference in the writing style of the student, as compared to previous work, or variations in font, grammar and spelling from section to section;
	- Testimony from others regarding a student’s use of academically dishonest means to complete the assignment;
	- An unusual or suspicious degree of similarity in work submitted by different students;
    - Admission by the student that s/he plagiarised
    
~~~

- Please do not distribute your code, or part thereof; to do so is enabling plagiarism and will be dealt with under the Level 1 plagiarism policy.
