There are three utilities in our utils package:

##ScannerInput

The [ScannerInput code is here](archives/ScannerInput.java) and the class structure is:

There are no changes required in this class; just add it to your project, into your utils package.  Refer to Topic05 materials for details on the ScannerInput, should you need more info.


##Utilities

The ShopV5.0 [Utilities code is here](archives/Utilities.java) and the class structure is:

![](img/utils03.png)

You can choose to add additional validation methods to this class should you wish.  

Regardless, just add the code above to your project, into your utils package and use it like we have been doing in labs.  Refer to [ShopV5.0](archives/ShopV5.0.zip) to see it in action as well as Topic05 materials.


##CategoryUtility

The CategoryUtility class is new and the class strcuture is:

![](img/utils04.png)

The static field, `categories` is an ArrayList of String and, at declaration time, defines the ArrayList values of:

- Home
- Work
- Hobby
- Holiday
- College

Hints for initialising an ArrayList at declaration time:  <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/initialize-an-arraylist-in-java/>


There are two static methods in it:

- `getCategories()` - a basic accessor that returns the categories ArrayList<String>.
- `isValidCategory(String)` - a basic validation method that takes in a category as a parameter and checks to see if it exists in the categories ArrayList<String>.  If it exists, return true.  Having looked at each element in the ArrayList, if it doesn't exist, return false. 

This utility class can be used to validate the category when reading it from the user (isValidCategory).  

It can also be used to print out valid categories to the user (getCategories).
