# App class

This is the super class in the hierarchy.  The responsibility for this *abstract* class is to manage an App.  The UML is here:

NOTES: 

- You may add additional instance fields of your choice (for extra credit!).  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow. 
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

## Fields

The following are private fields in the App class:

- **developer** : the developer has to be registered in the system in order to add them as a developer for an app (this validation should be handled in the Driver)
- **appName** : must be unique in the system (regardless of case - this validation should be handled in Driver).  Default value "No app name"
- **appSize** : measured in MB - range from 1 to 1000 inclusive.  Default value 0
- **appVersion** : version number >= 1.0.  Default value 1.0.
- **appCost** : zero or more...no upper limit.  default value 0.0 as apps can be free.
- **ratings** : contains all ratings for a specific app...the overall rating score is calculated from the arraylist entries.  Note how the Driver "simulates" ratings (code is given for that).


## Constructor Signature

~~~
    public App(Developer developer, String appName, double appSize, double appVersion, double appCost)

## Abstract method

There is one abstract method in this class (the three concrete classes will provide the implementation for it):

- isRecommendedApp()

The return type for this method can be read from the UML structure above.


## appSummary method

This method should build a one line string containing the following information and return it (note: no \n should be included in the String):

- app name
- app version
- developer
- app cost
- overall rating value (see: calculateRating method below)

It should be formatted similar to this:  **Evernote (V2.3) by Evernote Corporation, €3.99.  Rating: 3.6**


## Rating methods

This class has an ArrayList of Ratings.  We need to provide the CRUD methods for this collection here. The following methods are required:

- addRating(Rating) - add a rating to the **ratings** ArrayList. 
- listRatings() - build a string containing all the ratings and return it.  If no ratings have been added yet, return "No ratings added yet".
- calculateRating() - if no ratings have been added yet, return 0.  If ratings have been added, calculate the average value of the *numberOfStars* and return it.  Note: if a rating has a value of 0 for *numberOfStars*, this should not be included in the calculation.
