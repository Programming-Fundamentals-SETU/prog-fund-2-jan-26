# Utils Package

The utils package contains collections of utilities, grouped by function. 

In an earlier step, you downloaded and included the below utilities in your project.  

|  Name | Responsibility                                               |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ISerializer](archives/ISerializer.java)    | This interface is the same as that used in lectures and labs.  It should be implemented by both the AppStoreAPI and DeveloperAPI for XML persistence in these classes.  |
| [RatingUtility](archives/RatingUtility.java)  | This class generates a random rating for an app, from a list of pre-populated authors and comments |
| [ScannerInput](archives/ScannerInput.java) | This is the same class from Assignment 1 and should be used for all user input. |
| [Utilities](archives/Utilities.java)  | This class contains utility methods used throughout the system in multiple classes.  This class stores the reusable Utility (general) methods in one area. |


## TODO for Utilities

- You can choose to validate without the use of these packages but it will be more time consuming and you will lose marks. 
- Make sure that you implement the ISerializer interface in DeveloperAPI and AppStoreAPI.
