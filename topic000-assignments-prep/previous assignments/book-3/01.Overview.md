#Overview

Your are tasked with developing an **App Store** system.  It is a menu-driven, console app that can store apps of the following type:

- EducationApp
- GameApp
- ProductivityApp

An app can only be added for existing Developers.  

The information entered via the app will be persisted in XML files.

---

#Coding the Assignment

You will be provided with full UML for the classes in the **App Store** system.  

From the coding perspective, you will be given a lot of starter code, with some classes fully completed and some partially completed.  You will need to fully code the inheritance hierarchy, the management of the collection of Apps, and the menu options for it.  More details on this later in the spec.

##Suggested Menu(s)

We have provided a suggested main menu, along with some sub menus.  Please feel free to deviate from it in any way you wish.
