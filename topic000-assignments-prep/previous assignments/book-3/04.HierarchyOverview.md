# Hierarchy Overview

The following UML diagram shows the Inheritance structure, with fields, constructors and methods:

## While developing this hierarchy, remember the following:

As soon as you have entered the fields for a class in IntelliJ, generate boilerplate methods i.e. 

- **constructors**: should adhere to any validation rules outlined for the instance fields.  Note: if the value passed as a parameter is invalid, the default value (set at field declaration time) should remain in place.
- **getters** - each instance field should have a getter method.  
- **setters** - each instance field should have a setter method.  Setters should adhere to the validation rules outlined for the instance fields.  However, a setter should not apply a default value; it should only update the field if the value passed as a parameter was valid. 
- **equals** - no changes from the genereated code here.
- **toString** - methods in the subclasses (*EducationApp, GameApp, ProductivityApp*) should return a String version of the current object state as well as the object state of the super class, *App*.  

When coding any validation rules in the constructor and setters, you should use methods from the *utils* classes to perform the validation (see **utils** tab for more information).  

Pay attention to the format and the icons in the UML code above...they will tell you a huge amount about writing the code.  We have included some helpful graphics below to illustrate this for you.
