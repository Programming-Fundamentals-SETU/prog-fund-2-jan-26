#Submitting your assignment


When you are ready to submit your assignment:

- Rename your project name using the naming convention **firstname_surname** e.g. mairead_meagher. (inside IntelliJ)

- Zip the folder containing all the project files, and name the folder **firstname_surname.zip**.  No WINRARs please!

- The deadline for this assignment is in Week 6: **18:00 Sunday, 6th March 2022**.


##Interviews

It is **compulsory** that you are interviewed on your submission in order to demonstrate both *Understanding* and *Authorship*.  

These interviews will typically take place  in labs the week after submission (i.e. Week 7/8).  

The grade for the interview is a multiplier for your assigment grade.  Should you fail to show for your interview, you will receive zero, resulting in an overall grade of zero for your submission.
