#Plan of attack

##Some key points to remember when coding your assignment

- You **must** use the names given for the Classes and Methods; failure to do so will result in reduced marks.

- For all variables, methods and classes used, please adhere to the naming standards discussed in class.

- Use internal, helper methods (i.e. private access methods) where appropriate.  The interface for your class **must** match the interface given in the assignment brief.  Deviating from the interface will result in reduced marks.  Note: the interface here refers to the fields, constructors and methods that are visible outside the class. 

- Your classes and methods should be Javadoc commented.

- Don't forget that you can get IntelliJ to generate methods such as getters, setters, constructors and toString.  It is a good idea to generate these methods and then add the additional requirements (such as validation) manually.  This will free up some time for concentrating on other areas of the assignment. 

- There should be absolutely *NO* **System.out.println** or **ScannerInput** reads in any class except for the Driver class.  If you have any such interaction with the user in any class other than Driver, you will lose marks.  Instead, you should be returning information back to Driver to print it.  Or passing information read in Driver to other classes via method parameters.


#Plan of Attack

The following is a suggest plan of attack to start and complete the assignment 

##Step 1
Create a new IntelliJ Project in the usual way. 

#Step 2
Create the packages as per Shop, i.e. controllers, main, models, utils.

#Step 3
Drag in the Utilities class (given [*here*](archives/Utilities.java)). You should get to know these Utility methods so that you can use them when useful.



#Step 4
Set up the test directory as per the JUnit tab in this section, including marking it as the test directory and adding JUnit5 when prompted. 

#Step 5
You should echo the packages structure form *src* in *test* as per:

#Step 6
Now drag your downloaded *UtilitiesTest.java* ((given [*here*](archives/test/UtilitiesTest.java))file into the *test*  directory, *utils* package.

![](img/demo-04.png)

You are now ready to run the tests. 

#Step 7
Right-click on the *UtilitiesTest.java* file.   

![](img/demo-01.png)

#Step 8

Click on 'Run UtilitiesTest'

You should see that all the tests have passed by seeing this at the bottom of the Intellij window: 

![](img/demo-2.png)

This means that the Utilities code that we have written works as planned. 


We now repeat this process for the rest of the project. i.e. 


#Step 9
Now, write the Item class in the *src* folder (models package) according to the spec in this document. (Use the Utilities methods to help you with validation). Then add the given ItemTest class (to the *test* folder/ *models* package models). You can run this test immediately as the JUnit environment is set up from the last step.
Then 'Run All Tests', here : 

![](img/demo-05.png)

If there are errors, fix these errors, and re-run. Continue doing this until you get the green lines. 
Do not be tempted to change the test code. Treat the test code as the  ultimate specification.

#Step 10
Next, write the *CategoryUtility* Class, test using the  [given CategoryUtilityTest](archives/test/CategoryUtilityTest.java). Repeat until you get it error free. 

#Step 12 
Next, create and write the code for *Note* (according to spec), then add the *NoteTest* test class to the test folder, run that test, keep improving code until the tests succeed. 

#Step 13
Next Next, create and write the code for *NoteAPI* (according to spec), then add the *NoteAPITest* test class to the test folder, run that test, keep improving code until the tests succeed. 

#Step 14
Next, create and write the code for *Driver* (according to spec), there is no tests available for *Driver* so be sure to fully test this yourself. 

When you have all the tests running and are happy with your own testing of Driver,  you are done.
