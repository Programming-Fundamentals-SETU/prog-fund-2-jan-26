# Doggie Day Care App

You are tasked with building a menu driven console app that can:

- manage any number of Dogs and their associated Owners
- store and load the data to/from an XML file


### Dog

This is an example of a Dog:

The properties associated with this particular dog class are:

|      Property                |         Value          |        Default Value   |
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| id                           | 9999                    | 1000                    |
| name                         | Buddy                  |                          |
| breed                        | Golden Retriver        |                           |
| dangerousBreed               | false                  |false                     |
| age                          | 7                   | 5                           |
| sex                          | M                     | F                         |
| neutered                     | true                   |  true                    |
| daysInKennel (array)       | true, true,  false, false, false                   | false, false,  false, false, false      |
| owners (ArrayList)               | owners details (see below) |               |

There are also 2 Constants which keep track of the daily price for a dog
|      Property                |         Value          |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| DANGEROUS_DAILY_RATE                           | 40                    |
| NONDANGEROUS_DAILY_RATE                         | 30                  |

The app should allow for any number of Dog objects to be added to it (i.e. an ArrayList of Dogs).  The app should also allow full CRUD on this list of Dogs.



### Dog Owners

Dogs have one or more owners for them

For each owner, the properties are:



|      Property                |         Value          |   Default Value          |
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| id                           | 159                    | 100               |
| name                         | Mary Smith                  |              |
| phoneNumber                  | 0987878781                  | UnKnown             |



The app should allow for 1 or more Owner objects to be added to a Dog (i.e. an ArrayList of Owners in Dog). The app should also allow full CRUD on the Owners associated with a Dog.
