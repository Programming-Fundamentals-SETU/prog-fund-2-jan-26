# 6. Work on TODOs


Now that you have your JUnit Tests compiling, you are ready to start working on the TODOs.  

It is advisable to work on the files in this order:

- Owner
- Dog
- DayCareAPI
- Driver


## GitHub

As you work on each TODO in each class, commit and push your changes to your remote repository in GitHub. 

You commit message should describe what changes you made; these are good rules for writing commit messages:

- Capitalise the first word in the message
- Do not end the message with a full stop
- The message should be no longer than 50 chars
- The message should be written in "imperative mood" i.e. like you are giving an order. For example "Add fix for weekly income calculation".
