# Client Brief – LeBark James -  Doggie Daycare

![](img/client.jpg) 

Hello, and thank you for developing our Doggie Daycare Management System! I’m LeBark James, and I run a busy daycare for dogs of all breeds and sizes. Keeping track of each dog’s details—like their attendance, breed, and whether they belong to a dangerous breed category—is crucial for ensuring a safe and organized environment. We also need to maintain records of their owners and quickly check which dogs are in the daycare on any given day. Ideally, I’d love a system that lets me easily add, remove, and view dogs, check attendance for specific days, and identify any special requirements (like neutering status or breed restrictions). A simple menu-driven interface would be perfect so my staff can use it efficiently. Your system will help us run the daycare smoothly and ensure every dog has a happy and safe stay!
