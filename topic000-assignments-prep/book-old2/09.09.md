# Extra Credit (maximum grade of 100%)

Extra 10% will be available if you include extra functionality e.g.:

- adding in extra functionality.
- additional robust error handling,
- fancy menu system,
- etc.

For example, if your grade was 70% and you added some extra credit functionality worth 6%, your final grade would be 76% (interview dependent).

**Note 1:** If you are making changes to the functionality, it may be the case that the tests will fail for that particular area. In this case, you are permitted to update the tests to reflect this new functionality, but please include a README with your project to indicate that you have done this.

**Note 2:** In order to qualify for these extra marks, you must have completed the functionality as specified.
