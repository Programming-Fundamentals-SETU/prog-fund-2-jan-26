#5. Vehicle class

This is the super class in the hierarchy.  The responsibility for this *abstract* class is to manage a Vehicle.  The UML is here:

NOTES: 

- You may add additional instance fields of your choice (for extra credit!).  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow. 
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

## Fields

The following are private fields in the Vehicle class:

- **manufacturer** : the manufacturer has to be registered in the system in order to add them as a manufacturer for a vehicle (this validation should be handled in the Driver)
- **regNumber** : must be unique in the system (regardless of case - this validation should be handled in Driver).  Default value "No reg ". There should be max 8 characters in *regNumber*.
- **model** : Default value "No model". There should be max 15 characters in *model*
- **cost** :  Default value 1000. Must be >= 1000, with no upper limit.
- **year** : must be between 2000 and 2023 (inclusive). Default value is 2000.


## Constructor Signature

~~~
    public Vehicle(String regNumber, String  model, float cost, Manufacturer manufacturer, int  year)
~~~


## Abstract method

There is one abstract method in this class (the three concrete classes will provide the implementation for it):

- getCarbonFootPrint()

The return type for this method can be read from the UML structure above.


## toString method

This method should build a one line string containing the following information and return it (note: no \n should be included in the String):

- reg number
- model
- cost
- manufacturer (name and number of employees)
- age (the string shoud contain:
  - "Brand New" if the age of the vehicle is 0
  - "1 year old" if the age of the vehicle is 1
  - "x years old" if the age of the vehicle is >1 (x stands for the age number))



## getAge method

This is a calculated field and is calculated by finding the difference between the current year (2023) and the vehicle's year, (e.g. year is 2010 - age is 13)

## JUnit Test Class

The Test Class for **Vehicle** (VehicleTest.java) is included in the starter code and fully written. Because Vehicle is an abstract class, the test Class creates a Scooter instance and tests the Vehicle fields only of it. So to run this 'Vehicle' test you also need to have Scooter started (even dummy methods as per UML will do to get started)
