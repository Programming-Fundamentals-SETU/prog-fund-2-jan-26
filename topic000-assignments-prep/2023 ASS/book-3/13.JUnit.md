##13. JUnit

- **VehicleTest** - The Vehicle (abstract) class is fully tested [here](archives/VehicleTest.java)
- **ScooterTest** - The Scooter class is fully tested [here](archives/ScooterTest.java)
- **ManufacturerTest** - this is fully tested [here](archives/ManufacturerTest.java)
- **VehicleAPITest** - this is partially tested, ***you need to complete this to 90-100%***.  Starter code is [here](archives/VehicleAPITest.java)


## What you need to develop from scratch:

- **CarTest** - model this on the Scooter code above.  Aim for 90-100% coverage.
- **ElectricCarTest** - model this on the Scooter code above.  Aim for 90-100% coverage
- **CarbonFuelCarTest** - model this on the Scooter code above.  Aim for 90-100% coverage
- 
- **VehicleAPITest** - achieve a code coverage of at least 90% (starter test code provided above).  Note: code coverage percentage is based on all the functionality completed.
