# Extra Credit (maximum grade of 100%)

Extra 10% will be available if you include extra functionality e.g.:

- adding in extra functionality.
- fancy menu system,
- etc.

For example, if your grade was 70% and you added some extra credit functionality worth 6%, your final grade would be 76% (interview dependent).

**Note 1:** If you include extras, please document them in your readme.md file. 

**Note 2:** In order to qualify for these extra marks, you must have completed the functionality as specified.
