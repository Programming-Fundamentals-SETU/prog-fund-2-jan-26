## 13. JUnit

- **PlanetarySystemAPITest** - The PlanetarySystemAPI  class is included as an example (in Starter Code)
- **CelestialBodyTest** - The CelestialBody (abstract) class is fully tested (in Starter Code)
- **StellarObjectTest** - The StellarObject (abstract) class is fully tested (in Starter Code)
- **StarTest** - The Star class is fully tested (in Starter Code)
- **PlanetarySystemTest** - this is fully tested (in Starter Code)
- **CelestialSystemAPITest** - this is partially tested, ***you need to complete this to 90-100%***.  (partal tests in Starter Code)

## What you need to develop from scratch:

- **PlanetTest** - model this on the StellarObjectTest code above.  Aim for 90-100% coverage.
- **GasPlanetTest** - model this on the StarTest code above.  Aim for 90-100% coverage

- **CelestialSystemAPITest** - achieve a code coverage of at least 90% (starter test code provided above).  Note: code coverage percentage is based on all the functionality completed.
