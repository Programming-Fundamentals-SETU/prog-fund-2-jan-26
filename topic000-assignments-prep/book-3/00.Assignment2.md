**Introduction**

 In astronomy, celestial bodies form the fundamental components of a planetary system. 
 These include planets, stars, asteroids, and comets, all interacting through gravity within their respective systems.
  
 In this program, we represent celestial bodies through a structured class hierarchy in Java.
 
 The base class, CelestialBody, defines the core attributes shared by all celestial entities.
 
  The class hierarchy is structured as follows:
  - Planet and Stellar inherit from CelestialBody.
  - GasPlanet, DwarfPlanet and IcePlanet are specialized types of Planet 
  - Star extends the Stellar class.
 
 This object-oriented design reflects real-world classifications of celestial objects, allowing for better representation of planetary systems.
