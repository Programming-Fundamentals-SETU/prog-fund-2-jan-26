# 5. Javadoc

As you code away, good practice is to Javadoc your public classes and methods.  A Javadoc comment is enclosed in /** */ and typically uses annotations (@) within it.

You will notice, in the code we gave at the start of this lab, that there are a lot of Javadoc comments included.  

For example:

~~~
package models;

/**
 * A scaled down version of a models.Product class
 *
 * @author Mairead Meagher, Siobhan Drohan
 * @version 3.0
 */
public class Product {

    private String productName = "";
    private int productCode = -1;
    private double unitCost = 0;
    private boolean inCurrentProductLine = false;

    /**
     * Constructor for objects of class models.Product
     * @param productName Name of the product
     * @param productCode Code of the product
     * @param unitCost Unit cost of the product
     */
    public Product(String productName, int productCode, double unitCost, boolean inCurrentProductLine) {
        this.productName = productName;
        this.productCode = productCode;
        this.unitCost = unitCost;
        this.inCurrentProductLine = inCurrentProductLine;
    }

    //-------
    //getters
    //-------
    /**
     * Returns the Product Name
     * @return productName
     */
    public String getProductName(){
        return productName;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the Unit Cost
     * @return unitCost
     */
    public double getUnitCost(){
        return unitCost;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the Product Code
     * @return productCode
     */
    public int getProductCode() {
        return productCode;
    }

    /**
     * Returns a boolean indicating if the product is in the current product line
     * @return inCurrentProductLine
     */
    public boolean isInCurrentProductLine() {
        return inCurrentProductLine;
    }

    //-------
    //setters
    //-------
    /**
     * Updates the Product Code to the value passed as a parameter
     * @param productCode The new Product Code
     */
    public void setProductCode(int productCode) {
        this.productCode = productCode;
    }

    /**
     * Updates the Product Name to the value passed as a parameter
     * @param productName The new Product Name
     */
    public void setProductName(String productName) {
        this.productName = productName;
    }

    /**
     * Updates the Unit Cost to the value passed as a parameter
     * @param unitCost The new unit cost for the product
     */
    public void setUnitCost(double unitCost) {
        this.unitCost = unitCost;
    }

    /**
     * Updates the boolean indicating whether the product is in the current product line or not.
     * @param inCurrentProductLine Indicator that determines if the product is in the current product line or not.
     */
    public void setInCurrentProductLine(boolean inCurrentProductLine) {
        this.inCurrentProductLine = inCurrentProductLine;
    }

    /**
     * Builds a String representing a user friendly representation of the object state
     * @return Details of the specific product
     */
    public String toString()
    {
        return "models.Product description: " + productName
                + ", product code: " + productCode
                + ", unit cost: " + unitCost
                + ", currently in product line: " + inCurrentProductLine;
    }

}

## Class comments

A class comment is placed directly above the class definition and typically describes the single responsibility of the class.  If you look at the class comment for this class, you will notice that we are using two annotations; one to indicate the authors and the other to indicate the version number. 

~~~
/**
 * A scaled down version of a models.Product class
 *
 * @author Mairead Meagher, Siobhan Drohan
 * @version 3.0
 */
~~~


## Method comments

Method comments are placed directly above the associated public method (note, you don't Javadoc private methods) and typically contain @param and/or @return annotations.  See their use in the getter and setter below:

~~~
    /**
     * Returns a boolean indicating if the product is in the current product line
     * @return inCurrentProductLine
     */
    public boolean isInCurrentProductLine() {
        return inCurrentProductLine;
    }


    /**
     * Updates the boolean indicating whether the product is in the current product line or not.
     * @param inCurrentProductLine Indicator that determines if the product is in the current product line or not.
     */
    public void setInCurrentProductLine(boolean inCurrentProductLine) {
        this.inCurrentProductLine = inCurrentProductLine;
    }

~~~


It is good practice to write Javadoc comments as soon as you have finished testing a class/method and are happy that it is working as expected.  In future labs, we will show you how to generate a static website from your Javadoc comments.
