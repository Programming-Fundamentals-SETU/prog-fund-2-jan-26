# 2. Demo Exercise

This step introduces a way to write, keep and check your exercises on IntelliJ.

For each exercise, you should write the code in its own method and give it a similiar method header to this, where X is the number of the exercise:

~~~
    public void exercise_X()
~~~

## Exercise 1

Perform these steps:

- In IntelliJ, create a new Project called **ArrayExercises**.

- Create a new class in this Project called **Driver**.  Within this class, declare a Scanner object called `input` and also create a new main method with the following code:

~~~
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Driver driver = new Driver();
        driver.exercise_1();
    }
~~~

- In Driver, write a method `exercise_1` that will read in 6 integers into an integer array and then print out the values to the screen.

- Run your code to see does it work as expected.



## Solution to Exercise 1

~~~
import java.util.*;

public class Driver {

    private Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Driver driver = new Driver();
        driver.exercise_1();   
    }

    public void exercise_1() {

        int[] numbers = new int[6];

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length ; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter value : ");
            numbers[i] = input.nextInt();
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length ; i++) {
            System.out.println("value " + (i+1)  + " is: " + numbers[i]);
        }
    }

}
