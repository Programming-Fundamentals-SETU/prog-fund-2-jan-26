# 7. Exercises

In this step, we will apply what we learned so far to a new domain, A Social Network, menu driven app:

![NewsFeed Menu](./img/05a.png)

This app will allow the user to enter a series of message posts which they can then display on their newsfeed:

## SocialNetworkV1.0

Create a new project called `SocialNetworkV1.0` and within the src folder, add the following classes:

- `ScannerInput`
- `MessagePost`
- `NewsFeed`
- `Driver`


## ScannerInput class

Clone (copy) the ScannerInput class from your ShopV3.0 and paste it into this class.


## MessagePost Class

In this class, add the following **private** instance fields:

- String `author` with an initial value of ""
- String `message` with an initial value of ""
- int `likes` with an initial value of 0

This will be the class structure:

![NewsFeed Class Structure](./img/05.png)

Using the above class structure, you can choose to hand code the constructor along with accessors and mutators for each instance field.  OR you can choose to generate them in IntelliJ like so:

- Once you have typed in the above instance fields, right click below them and select **Generate...** from the menu that appears.  

You will then be presented with this window:

![Generate... Menu](./img/06.png)

- Select the **constructor** option and when the window appears, select both `author` and `message` and click ok. 

![Generate Constructor](./img/07.png)

- The following code will be generated:

~~~
    public MessagePost(String author, String message) {
        this.author = author;
        this.message = message;
    }
~~~

- Repeat this process to generate getters and setters for each instance field.  

Before moving on, verify that your code and your class structure resembles the screen shot below. Note: you can click on the **Structure** tab to see the summary contents of a class:

![NewsFeed Class](./img/08.png)

To complete the MessagePost class, add the following `display` method:

~~~
    public String display() {
        String str = "";

        str += (author + "\n");

        if(likes > 0) {
            str += ("  -  " + likes + " people like this.\n");
        }
        else {
            str += "0 likes.\n";
        }

        if (!message.isEmpty()){
            str += "\t" + message + "\n";
        }
        return str;
    }
~~~


## NewsFeed class

- In the NewsFeed class, add this **private** instance field: `ArrayList<MessagePost> posts` 

- Add a constructor that instantiates the above ArrayList.

- Add a method **addPost()** that accepts a `MessagePost` object as a parameter. This method should add the passed `MessagePost` object to the **posts** ArrayList.

- Add a method **show()** that returns a String comprising the index number and the **display** details for each MessagePost in the posts ArrayList.  If there are no posts in the ArrayList, the String "No Posts" should be returned.


## Driver class

In the Driver class, add the following instance field:

~~~
 private NewsFeed newsFeed = new NewsFeed();
~~~

Using ShopV3.0 as a support, create this menu system in Driver:

![NewsFeed Menu](./img/05a.png)

As you can see from the Driver class structure below, there are two new methods, namely addMessagePost and showPosts.  These will be the two methods that are called from the switch statement for option 1 and 2 respectively.

## Run and Test

Run the project.

Test by adding a series of messages and listing them.  Also try listing the messages when no messages have been entered.
