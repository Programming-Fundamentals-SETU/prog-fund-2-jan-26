# 4. JUnit Tests

The `test` folder, coloured green, contains a series of completed *JUnit* test automation classes.

You should **NOT** make any changes in these files.  Instead, you will work in your *src* folder.

When you open these test classes, you will notice they don't compile. 


## Add JUnit to your Build Path

You may need to add JUnit to your build path.  To do this:

- Right Click on any of the annotations (i.e. @Before, @After, @Test, etc) and choose 'Show Context Actions'
- If 'Add JUnit5.70' to classpath' is an option, choose it. This will link the JUnit library to the project.



## We have LOTS of compile errors...


You have these because you haven't written any of the code in the *src* folder yet.  The next step will show you how to fix a few compile errors and you can fix the rest as part of your assignment work (marks are awarded for fixing these errors).
