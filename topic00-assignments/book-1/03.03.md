# IntelliJ and GitHub

You should now have a repository created in our classroom.  Click on your unique link (it will be different to our one, as it will have your GitHub user name instead of maireadmeagher):

You will be taken to your remote repository where you will work on the assignment:

To work on the assignment, you need to download a local copy of this to your computer, via IntelliJ.


## Remote URL

In the above screen shot, you can see that the URL for **OUR** private remote repository is:


- https://github.com/Prog-Fund/formative-assignment-pf2-maireadmeagher


You WON'T have access to our URL - this is Mairead and Siobhans one.  

Instead, you use your own personal URL to the repo that was just generated.  It will be along this format i.e.:

- https://github.com/Prog-Fund/shop-product-validation-YOUR-GITHUB-ID


Make a note of **your** URL...you will need this in a few moments (and also later in the lab). If you are having trouble finding your URL, just to go your GitHub account and you should find the repo in there.


## IntelliJ: Linking to your Remote Repo

Launch IntelliJ.

When the splash screen appears, you will notice there are three options:

So far, you have used the first two:

- New Project
- Open

You will now use the thid option: **Get from VCS** (Note: VCS stands for Version Control Software...this is what GitHub is).

Click on the **Get from VCS** button and the following dialog will be shown:

**Repository URL** should be highlighted on the left hand side of the screen.  

As you already have a starter project with starter code created for you (i.e. your remote repository in GitHub Classroom), you want to clone this to your local machine. 

In the **URL** box, enter the URL for **your** remote repository (the one you made a note of earlier):

And choose a location on your computer for the local copy of the code to reside (OneDrive if you are using college computers).  

Click the **Clone** button.

You will be asked to either 'Login in via GitHub' or 'Use Token'

Pick the 'Use Token' option.
You will see the following:

Press 'Generate'
You will be brought to the following screen: 
![](img/32.png)
The 'IntelliJ IDEA GitHub integration plugin' note will serve as the identifier and as such will  need to be unique. 

Use a name e.g. pf2-fa-05022025    (last string is date) 
Go to the end of the page and press 'Generate Token' 
You will see the following page (or something similar) 
![](img/33.png)

Copy this token. 

Then return to IntelliJ and paste the token into the 'Token' field.

Then press 'Login'

You may be asked if you trust the project...you do:

if you are asked to give access to GitHub - accept all defaults. This includes 'Authorize JetBrains'

A local copy of the remote project should now open in IntelliJ.  It should look like this...

**Make sure that your project looks the same as our screen shot above before continuing.**
