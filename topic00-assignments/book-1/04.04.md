# Project Structure - src

In the screen shot below, you can see that we have two main folders:

- `src` coloured blue
- `test` coloured green

## src folder

Let's look at the `src` folder first.  There are three java files in it:

- **Product:** manages a single product and has four instance fields.
- **Store:** manages a primitive array of products.
- **Driver:** handles the user and entry point to the program.

This is ShopV2.3 from last semester.  

Run the app and re-familiarise yourself with it and the code in these three classes. 


## src - Product 

We will be working in the Product class only for this formative assignment.


 
You are asked to implement the validation rules as defined in the Product clas comments :

## Manually Testing this Code

Run the app.  Enter two products, one that is in the current product line and one that isn't.  

You should see, when you list the products, that  "TO DO WRITE TOSTRING" is printed instead.  You need to rewrite toString() to return a String as explained in the comments of toString() 


You have now **manually** tested that the required functionality is in place.



Now, work on the validations.

We still have three TODO comments to work on and these are for validating the instance fields.
