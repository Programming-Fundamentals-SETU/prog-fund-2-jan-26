# 4. Hierarchy Overview

The following UML diagram shows the Inheritance structure:

## While developing this hierarchy, remember the following:

As soon as you have entered the fields for a class in IntelliJ, generate boilerplate methods i.e. 

- **constructors**: should adhere to any validation rules outlined for the instance fields.  Note: for all data types apart from Strings - if the value passed as a parameter is invalid, the default value (set at field declaration time) should remain in place. In the case of strings the constructor should truncate the field (if the validation includes a maximum length).
- **getters** - each instance field should have a getter method.  
- **setters** - each instance field should have a setter method.  Setters should adhere to the validation rules outlined for the instance fields.  However, a setter should not apply a default value; it should only update the field if the value passed as a parameter was valid. 
- **equals** - no changes from the generated code here. (You should delete hashCode method generated with equals if you wish - it won't cause any problems to leave it in but it is not used.)
- **toString** - methods in the subclasses (*Star, GasPlanet, IcePlanet, DwarfPlanet*) should return a String version of the current object state as well as the object state of the super class, *Planet or StellarObject* (and, when applicable, *CelestialBody*).  

When coding any validation rules in the constructor and setters, you should use methods from the *utils* classes to perform the validation (see **utils** tab for more information).  

We have included some helpful graphics below to illustrate this for you.

Pay attention to the format and the icons in the UML code above...they will tell you a huge amount about writing the code.
