# 12. Utils Package

The utils package contains collections of utilities, grouped by function. 

These are included in the Starter Code. Ensure that you inderstand any you use.  

|  Name | Responsibility                                               |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ISerializer   | This interface is the same as that used in lectures and labs.  It should be implemented by both the TechnologyAPI and ManufacturerAPI for XML persistence in these classes.  |
| CoreCompositionUtility | This class contains utility methods used to validate Core Compositions |
| SpectralTypeUtility | This class contains utility methods used to validate Spectral Types |
| ScannerInput | This is the same class from Assignment 1 and should be used for all user input. |
| Utilities  | This class contains utility methods used throughout the system in multiple classes.  This class stores the reusable Utility (general) methods in one area. |


## TODO for Utilities

- You can choose to validate without the use of these packages but it will be more time consuming and you will lose marks. 
- Make sure that you implement the ISerializer interface in PlanetarySystemAPI and CelestialSystemAPI.
