NOTES: 
 
- You may add additional instance fields of your choice (for extra credit!).  If you do so, the method list and parameters for existing methods will change/grow.  
- The **Hierarchy Overview** tab has generic information on coding constructors, getters, setters and toString.  The information below is just the specifics related to this class.

## Fields

There are 3 extra private fields in this class:


|      Property                |         Value          |        Default Value   |        Description  |
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| gasComposition          | mostly gas              | (20 chars)                   | max 20 chars|
| coreComposition          | Rocky and Metallic              | UNKNOWN             |  Must be one of Rocky and Metallic, Proportionally Small, Liquid Metallic Hydrogen Compressed Hydrogen or Ice Giant default UNKNOWN can use CoreCompositionUtility class|
| radiationLevel          | .02             | .9                 | Higher in gas giant min .01 max 200.05 default .9|

## Constructor

There is one constructor for this class. The parameter list for this constructor should be the same as the parameter list for the PLanet class but with the additional field above .  The constructor should call the superclass constructor and also instantiate the field.

~~~
  public GasPlanet(String name, double mass, double diameter, PlanetarySystem planetarySystem, double averageTemperature, String surfaceType, boolean hasLiquidWater, String gasComposition, String coreComposition, double radiationLevel) 
    
   
~~~


## Abstract method

`displayInfo` - this method returns a String 
~~~
        // return the String with the field information
        e.g. Gas Composition: mostly Gas, Core Composition: Rocky and Metallic radiationLevel:   200
        
~~~
`classifyBody` - this method returns a String 
~~~
        // return the String with the the text "Gas Planet" in it
        
~~~


## JUnit Test Class

This is a concrete class and you should write a Test Case for this class
