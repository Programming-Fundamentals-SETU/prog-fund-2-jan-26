# Array Exercises

To start we suggest you use the following main method : 

~~~
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        //To run any method, just uncomment it and run the main method.
       Main menu = new Main();
       menu.exer1();
       //menu.exer2();
      //  menu.exer3();
      //  menu.exer4();
      //  menu.exer5();
      //  menu.exer6();
      //  menu.exer7();
    }
~~~

When you write a method and want to check it - uncomment the call for that method (to start we have left the call to exer1() uncommented)
