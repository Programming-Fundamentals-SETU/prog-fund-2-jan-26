# Test Directory

In this step, you will create a Test Directory with one starter test class, ProductTest.java. 

*Note: you may need to refer to this weeks lecture slides for support here.*


## Creating the New Project

Create a new project called ShopV6.0 in IntelliJ and create four packages: **controllers, main, models and utils**.  

Add the following classes into their respective package:

- [Driver.java](archives/Driver.java) into main.

- [Store.java](archives/Store.java) into controllers.

- [Product.java](archives/Product.java) into models.

- [ScannerInput.java](archives/ScannerInput.java) into utils.

- [Utilities.java](archives/Utilities.java) into utils.


## Setting up the Component for Serializing

Download the XStream, version 1.4.20 jar file from this website:

- <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream/1.4.20>

In IntelliJ, right click on the ShopV6.0 project folder and select **New**, followed by **Directory**.  Call the new directory **lib**.  Drag the xstream jar file already downloaded into the lib folder.

From **File** menu, select **Project Structure**.  Click on **Libraries**.  To add a library to your build path, click on the +.  Select Java and locate the XStream compenent in your lib folder…click OK (a few times!).


## Creating the Test Directory

In IntelliJ, Create a new directory called **test** and right click on it.  Select the option *Mark Directory as* and select **Test Sources Root**.

Now we will mimic the package structure that is in your src folder, except for the main package i.e. to the **test** folder, add the packages controllers, models and utils.

Your current project structure should look like this(jar file name wil be different):

## Creating the starter ProductTest.java class

Open Product.java. Click above the class declaration, then click on the light bulb…select Create Test:

Choose JUnit5 and Click the *Fix* button below it:

...and click the OK button do download JUnit5 from Maven.

Now that JUnit5 is downloaded…select the checkboxes as shown to generate test methods.  Note the class name is set to ProductTest:

ProductTest.java is generated with starting code.
