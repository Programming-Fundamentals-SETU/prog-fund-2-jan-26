# Test Largest

In lecture 4 of this topic, we covered testing a static method called TestLargest.  We had some errors in the code and we watched how we could pick up these errors using best-practice Test Driven Development practices and approaches. 

Download the TestLargest code from [here](archives/TestLargest.zip) and experiment with generating these errors and the effect they have on the JUnit tests.
