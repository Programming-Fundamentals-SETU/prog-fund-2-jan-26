# Exercises

The solutions for the test classes, so far is here:

- [ProductTest.java](archives/ProductTest.java)
- [StoreTest.java](archives/StoreTest.java)


## Coverage Report

Now that we have written test classes for both Product and Store, we can run a **coverage report** in IntelliJ to see how comprehensive our tests are (i.e. are they testing ever possible path in the code).

To do this, right click on the green **test** folder and select *More Run/Debug*, followed by *Run All Tests with Coverage*:

When the tests have run, you will see that % values for both methods and lines covered are added to our project view:

These numbers indicate the % of the methods and lines of code, for each class, that are covered by the automated testing. 

We can see that Product is 100% tested, however Store is only 35% tested; we only wrote test methods for the ArrayList CRUD and also the find method. 

Notice that ScannerInput and main are 0% as we wrote no tests for them.

However, the Utilities class is 75% tested...this is because we tested them via the Product and the Store.  BUT, we can still write our own, standalone test class for Utilities.


## UtilitiesTest.java

Copy this code into the test/utils folder.  

- [UtilitiesTest.java](archives/UtilitiesTest.java)

This is the test code that we are using in our assignment.   We will reuse it here too.

Now run the test coverage report again and the % values for the Utilities should change:

## ScannerInput and main

We won't be using JUnit to test both the ScannerInput.java and the main.java code.  

Can you think of a really good reason why? 

- What happens when the menu is printed to the user? 

- The program goes into "suspended" mode...waiting for the user to type in a value and hit enter

- As the program goes into this suspension, we cannot use JUnit to automate it.


## Assignment - Test Classes

Now that you have more knowledge of JUnit tests, look at your assignment spec and familiarise yourself with the testing section.
