# 8. Challenges

##  Most Frequent Element:
Write a method that takes an ArrayList<String> and returns the element that appears as the most frequent. If the list has fewer than two distinct elements, return an appropriate message or value.

## Common Elements (Intersection):
Given two ArrayList<Integer> objects, create a method that returns a new ArrayList<Integer> containing only the elements that appear in both lists. The order in the result should follow their first appearance in the first list.

## Longest String Finder:
Write a function that finds and returns the longest string in an ArrayList<String>. In the event of a tie (i.e., multiple strings having the same maximum length), return the first string encountered.

## Elements Below Average:
Create a method that accepts an ArrayList<Double>, computes the average value, and returns a new ArrayList<Double> containing only the elements that are below that average.
