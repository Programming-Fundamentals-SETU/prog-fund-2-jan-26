# 4. Refactoring the Driver Class

In this step, you will refactor (change) the Driver class so that any changes we made to the public **Interface** of the Store class are reflected in this class.


## Store Constructor

The only change that we made to the public **Interface** of the Store class is the Store Constructor.

By using an ArrayList, we removed the need to know the size of the collection at the start of the program.  For this reason we deleted the numberItems from the Store constructor's parameter list. 

In the Driver class, in the processOrder method, you will find this code:

~~~
        //find out from the user how many products they would like to order
        System.out.print("How many Products would you like to have in your Store?  ");
        int numberProducts = input.nextInt();

        store = new Store(numberProducts);
~~~

For the moment, leave the code in that asks the user how many products they want to enter (we will come back to this in the next step!).

Just remove the parameter that is passed to the Store constructor.  This line of code should now be:

~~~java
    store = new Store();
~~~


## Run and Test

Try running your code; the functionality for the user should not have changed in any way.  

Your output should look similar to this:
