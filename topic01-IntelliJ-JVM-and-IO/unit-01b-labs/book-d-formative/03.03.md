# Task Description

You are required to convert your Library assignment from BlueJ into a working IntelliJ project.

This is not a redesign of the program. Your goal is to:

- Recreate the project structure in IntelliJ

- Copy and organise your existing Java classes

- Ensure the program compiles and runs correctly

## Instructions

1. Install IntelliJ IDEA

2. Open IntelliJ and familiarise yourself with the interface.

3. Create a New IntelliJ Project

4. Create a new Java project in IntelliJ.

5. Use a suitable project name (e.g. LibrarySystem).

6. Add Java class files corresponding to those in your BlueJ project 

7. Copy the code from each class in your BlueJ project into the corresponding class in IntelliJ.

8. Do not change the logic of your program unless required to fix errors.

9. Resolve Errors

10. Fix any syntax or runtime errors that appear.

11. Run the Program

12. Ensure your program runs successfully in IntelliJ.

    - Confirm that it behaves the same way as it did in BlueJ.
    - Make sure all required functionality from the original assignment still works.
