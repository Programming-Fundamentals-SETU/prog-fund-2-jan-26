# Formative Assessment: Converting a BlueJ Project to IntelliJ

The aim of this formative assessment is to help you transition from using BlueJ to IntelliJ IDEA, a professional Java development environment.

This assessment is formative and is intended to support your learning. Feedback will be provided, but it does not contribute to your final grade.
