# 5. Challenge

The first part of  exercise will help you become more familiar with the Scanner class as well as working with a two class app.
The second part of this exercise will helpl you to become more familiar with the process of implementing validation techniques as discussed in Lab 2

## Part 1 - Scanner Class

This console based app will ask the user to enter their personal details.  Their details will then be printed back to the console. 

During this challenge, you may need to view this weeks lecture notes to remind you how to write classes.  The ShopV1.0 solution will also come in handy here.

- In IntelliJ, create a new Java Project called **UserDetailsProject**.

- Within this project, create two new Classes; **User** and **Driver**.


## User Class

In the User class, create four private instance fields:

- private String name;

- private String address;

- private String dateOfBirth;

- private double height;


Write a constructor for this class that takes the four instance fields as parameters and updates the object state using these parameters.  Note: no need for field validation yet.

Write a getter for each instance field.  

Write a setter for each instance field.  Note: no need for field validation yet.

Write a toString method that builds and returns a String comprising a user friendly representation of the object state.


## Driver Class

In the Driver class, create two private instance fields:

- input of type Scanner (initialise this field using **new Scanner(System.in)**) 
- user of type User

Write a method called **addUser()** that asks the user to input their details (name, address, date of birth, height).  Use this data to create a new User object.

Write a method called **printUser()** that prints all the user details to the console.  Hint: use the toString() method from the User class.

Write a **main** method that creates an object of Driver and invokes both addUser and printUser over the object.


## Run the App

Run the app; does all work as expected?  Are you asked to enter the user details?  Are all details you entered printed back to the console?

## Part 2

In this part of the class you are asked to implement the following validations on the User class:

 -  String name    -  validation - max 20 characters - max 20 characters - truncate to 20 chars in constructor if > 20
 -  String name   -  validation - max 30 characters - max 30 characters - truncate to 30 chars in constructor if > 30
 -  String dateOfBirth  -  validation - max 10 charactersmax 10 characters - truncate to 20 chars in constructor if > 10
 -  double height = 0.5;   0.5 <= validation <= 3    (metres) - default to 0.5

 When testing, use this [Driver](archives/UserDetailsWithValidation/src/Driver.java) to help you.
