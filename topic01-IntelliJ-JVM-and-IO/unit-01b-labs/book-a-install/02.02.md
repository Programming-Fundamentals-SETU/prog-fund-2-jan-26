Scroll down and select the exectuable version (the installer, not the compressed archive) most suitable for your operating system:

If you are using windows, your download is likely to be for Windows 64 (note version numbers may differ) e.g.:

- jdk-16.0.2-windows-x64-bin.exe

If you are using a mac, your download is likely to be (note version numbers may differ) e.g.:

- jdk-16.0.2-osx-x64-bin.dmg

Once the exe/dmg file is downloaded, follow the steps to install it on your computer. 

To check if it is installed ok - you should type in the following command into the command prompt/terminal window we opened earlier

~~~
java -version
~~~

If your install was successful, you should get something like this:

~~~
C:\Users\Siobhan>java -version
java version "16.0.2" 2021-07-20
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 16.0.2+7-67)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.2+7-67, mixed mode, sharing)

C:\Users\Siobhan>
~~~

Note: if it isn't displaying the version you just installed, try closing the command prompt, then reopen it and try the command again.  If this doesn't work, it is typically a problem with your environmental variables; you lecturer will be able to help you with this.

You have just installed the JDK and it can be found in this windows location (assuming you selected the default locations when installing the kit):
