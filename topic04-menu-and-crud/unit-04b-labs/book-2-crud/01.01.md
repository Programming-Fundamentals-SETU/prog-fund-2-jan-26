# 2. Developing Shop V4.0 

In this practical, you will create a new project called ShopV4.0 in IntelliJ. You will add the Driver, Store and Product classes (linked below) to this project and amend the code so that it presents the user with the following simple menu for adding, listing, updating and deleting products (see Figure 1).

## Starting ShopV4.0

Create a new project called ShopV4.0.

Copy the following classes into the project:

- [Driver.java](archives/Driver.java)

- [Store.java](archives/Store.java)

- [Product.java](archives/Product.java)

- [ScannerInput.java](archives/ScannerInput.java)


Familiarise yourself with these classes by reviewing the code.  Remember, with the ScannerInput, you just need to know how to use the methods; we will cover the exact workings of the code in each method in future labs. 

Run the project.  

- Before we start adding new code, test the options to make sure the code is working as expected.
