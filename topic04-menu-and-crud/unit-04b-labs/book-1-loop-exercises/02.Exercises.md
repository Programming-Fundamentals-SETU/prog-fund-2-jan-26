# 3. Exercises

Attempt the following exercises on loops.  For each exercise:

- Add a method to the Loops class (as was done in the demo step).

- use the global Scanner object to read in data from the user, if required.

- call your writen method from the main class (and comment out calls to other methods).

- Remember, the object of this lab is to give you practice with loops in an ArrayList context.  So it is important you utilise loops throughout.

*You may need to refer back to your lecture notes during this lab*


## Exercise 1 - n-times loops

Write a method to:

- read in 6 Strings into an ArrayList of String (use an n-times while loop for this)
- and then print the values out (use an n-times for loop here)

Call this method exercise_1 and don't forget to instantiate the ArrayList (we have done it here for you):

~~~
    private void exercise_1(){
        strings = new ArrayList<>();
        //code goes here!
    }
~~~


## Exercise 2 - for each loop

Copy your exercise_1 method and paste it as exercise_2.

Now rewrite:

- the reading of the strings to use an n-times for loop
- and the printing of the value to use a for-each loop

Now call this new method from the main method.  There should be no visible difference from the console perspective; we only changed the internal workings of the code.


## Exercise 3 - sentinel based loops

In the previous exercises, we took in 6 strings.  In this one, we will use a sentinel to stop the input of Strings.  This will let the user decide how many Strings they want to enter.

Copy your exercise_1 method and paste it as exercise_3.

Now rewrite: 

- the reading of the strings to be controlled by a sentinel based while loop where the String "-end" ends the intake of data from the console.  Remember to use the .equals() method when testing for equality. 

- the printing of the strings to use a for each loop.

Your console output should look something like this:

## Exercise 4 - flag based loops

In the previous exercise, we used a sentinel value to end the loop (i.e. "-end").  In this version, we will end the input when the user enters a string that **starts with** "end".  But we will construct it using a flag-based loop rather than a sentinel-based loop.  You can copy the exercise_3 method and paste it as exercise_4.  
Your console output should look something like this:
