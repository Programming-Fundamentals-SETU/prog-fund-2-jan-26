# 2. Demo Exercise

This step introduces a way to write and check your exercises on IntelliJ.

For each exercise, you should write the code in its own method and give it a similiar method header similar to this:

~~~ 
    private void simpleWhile()
~~~


## SimpleWhile Exercise

Perform these steps:

- In IntelliJ, create a new Project called **LoopExercises**.

- Create a class in this Project called **Loops**.   In this class, add the following code:

~~~
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Loops {

    ArrayList<String> strings;
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String args[]){
        Loops loops = new Loops();
        loops.simpleWhile();
    }

    private void simpleWhile() {

        System.out.println("This method will print 1 to 10 to the console:");

        int i = 1;
        while (i <= 10){
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }
    }
~~~

This method, simpleWhile, will print out 1 to 10 to the console.  Note that it is invoked from the main method, just after the constructor.

Note that Scanner and ArrayList objects are there for the exercises in the next step; we are not using them here.
